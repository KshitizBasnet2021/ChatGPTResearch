#1 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Disjoint\mutation_1_line_no_5_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The code is checking if all elements in A, B, and C are equal, and if not, it returns False. However, this logic is incorrect for checking if the three sets are disjoint.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if there are any common elements between the three sets. If there are any common elements, then the sets are not disjoint.

Here's the corrected code:

def disjoint1(A, B, C):
  for a in A:
    for b in B:
      for c in C:
        if a == b or a == c or b == c:
          return False
  return True


#2 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Disjoint\mutation_2_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `a != b == c` is incorrect. It should be `a != b and b != c and a != c` to check if all three elements are distinct.

Here's the corrected code:

def disjoint1(A, B, C):
  for a in A:
    for b in B:
      for c in C:
        if a != b and b != c and a != c:
          return False
  return True


#3 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Disjoint\mutation_3_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `if a == b != c` checks if `a` is equal to `b` and not equal to `c`. However, this condition does not guarantee that `a`, `b`, and `c` are all distinct. 

To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all distinct. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def disjoint1(A, B, C):
  for a in A:
    for b in B:
      for c in C:
        if a == b or a == c or b == c:
          return False
  return True
```

In this updated code, the condition `if a == b or a == c or b == c` checks if any two elements among `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal. If any such pair is found, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if no equal pairs are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the lists `A`, `B`, and `C` are disjoint.


#4 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\FInd\mutation_1_line_no_8_AOD.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the return statement at the end of the function. It should return -1 instead of 1 when the value is not found in the list.

Here's the corrected code:

def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1


#5 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\FInd\mutation_2_line_no_8_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the return statement at the end of the function. 

The current return statement is `return +1`, which will always return the value 1. However, the intention of the code is to return -1 if the value is not found in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to change the return statement to `return -1` instead of `return +1`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1
```


#6 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\FInd\mutation_3_line_no_7_ASR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The variable `j` is initialized to 0 and then decremented in the while loop. This will result in an infinite loop because `j` will never reach the condition `j < n`.

To fix this bug, we need to increment `j` instead of decrementing it. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1
```

In this corrected code, `j` is incremented in each iteration of the while loop, allowing it to eventually reach the condition `j < n` and terminate the loop.


#7 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\FInd\mutation_4_line_no_4_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be "j < n" instead of "not (j < n)". 

Here's the corrected code:

def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1


#8 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\FInd\mutation_5_line_no_5_COI.py
The code provided seems to be correct and does not contain any bugs. It is a simple implementation of a linear search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given value in a list or string. The code iterates through the elements of the list or characters of the string and returns the index of the first occurrence of the value if found, otherwise it returns -1.


#9 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\FInd\mutation_6_line_no_4_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be "j < n" instead of "j > n". 

Here's the corrected code:

def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1


#10 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\FInd\mutation_7_line_no_4_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `j < n` instead of `j <= n`. This is because the index of the last element in the list is `n-1`, so we should stop iterating when `j` reaches `n-1`.

Here's the corrected code:

def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1


#11 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\FInd\mutation_8_line_no_5_ROR.py
The provided code is missing proper indentation, which is essential in Python. Here's the corrected code:

def find(S, val):
    n = len(S)
    j = 0
    while j < n:
        if S[j] != val:
            return j
        j += 1
    return -1

The code itself looks fine and should work as expected. It iterates through the elements of the list `S` and returns the index of the first occurrence of `val`. If `val` is not found, it returns -1.


#12 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Find_max\mutation_1_line_no_4_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The logic inside the for loop is incorrect. Instead of checking if the current value is not greater than the current biggest value, it should be checking if the current value is greater than the current biggest value. 

Here's the corrected code:

def find_max(data):
  biggest = data[0]
  for val in data:
    if val > biggest:
      biggest = val
  return biggest


#13 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Find_max\mutation_2_line_no_4_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the comparison condition inside the for loop. The condition should be `if val > biggest` instead of `if val < biggest`. 

Here's the corrected code:

def find_max(data):
  biggest = data[0]
  for val in data:
    if val > biggest:
      biggest = val
  return biggest


#14 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Find_max\mutation_3_line_no_4_ROR.py
The provided code has a bug. If the input list is empty, the code will throw an IndexError because it tries to access the first element of an empty list.

To fix this, we can add a check at the beginning of the function to return None if the input list is empty. Here's the updated code:

def find_max(data):
  if len(data) == 0:
    return None
  
  biggest = data[0]
  for val in data:
    if val >= biggest:
      biggest = val
  return biggest


#15 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Prefix_averages\mutation_1_line_no_3_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the line `A = [0] / n`. It seems like the intention was to create a list of size `n` with all elements initialized to 0. However, the division operator `/` is used instead of the multiplication operator `*`. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the line to `A = [0] * n`. This will create a list of size `n` with all elements initialized to 0. 

Here is the corrected code:

def prefix_average3(S):
  n = len(S)
  A = [0] * n
  total = 0
  for j in range(n):
    total += S[j]
    A[j] = total / (j+1)
  return A


#16 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Prefix_averages\mutation_2_line_no_3_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the line `A = [0] // n`. The double forward slashes (`//`) are used for integer division in Python, which means the result will be an integer. In this case, it will always be 0 because dividing 0 by any number will result in 0. 

To fix this bug, we need to change `//` to `/` to perform floating-point division. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def prefix_average3(S):
  n = len(S)
  A = [0] * n
  total = 0
  for j in range(n):
    total += S[j]
    A[j] = total / (j+1)
  return A
```

Now, the code will correctly calculate the prefix averages of the input list `S`.


#17 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Prefix_averages\mutation_3_line_no_3_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The line `A = [0] ** n` is incorrect. It should be `A = [0] * n` to create a list of zeros with length `n`. 

Here is the corrected code:

def prefix_average3(S):
  n = len(S)
  A = [0] * n
  total = 0
  for j in range(n):
    total += S[j]
    A[j] = total / (j+1)
  return A


#18 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Prefix_averages\mutation_4_line_no_7_AOR.py
The provided code has a bug. The bug is in the line `total += S[j]`. It assumes that the elements of `S` are integers, but it does not check for this assumption. If `S` contains non-integer elements, such as strings or floats, the code will raise a `TypeError` when trying to add them to `total`.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the elements of `S` are integers before performing the addition. Here's the updated code:

```python
def prefix_average3(S):
  n = len(S)
  A = [0] * n
  total = 0
  for j in range(n):
    if not isinstance(S[j], int):
      raise TypeError("Elements of S must be integers")
    total += S[j]
    A[j] = total // (j + 1)
  return A
```

With this fix, if any element in `S` is not an integer, a `TypeError` will be raised with a helpful error message.


#19 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Prefix_averages\mutation_5_line_no_7_AOR.py
The code provided seems to be correct and does not contain any bugs. It calculates the prefix averages of a given list correctly.


#20 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Prefix_averages\mutation_6_line_no_7_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the line `A[j] = total / (j - 1)`. The denominator should be `j + 1` instead of `j - 1`. 

Here is the corrected code:

def prefix_average3(S):
  n = len(S)
  A = [0] * n
  total = 0
  for j in range(n):
    total += S[j]
    A[j] = total / (j + 1)
  return A


#21 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Prefix_averages\mutation_7_line_no_6_ASR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `total -= S[j]`. It should be `total += S[j]` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

def prefix_average3(S):
  n = len(S)
  A = [0] * n
  total = 0
  for j in range(n):
    total += S[j]
    A[j] = total / (j+1)
  return A


#22 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Unique\mutation_1_line_no_3_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The inner loop should start from `j + 1` instead of `j - 1`. This is because we want to compare each element in the list `S` with all the elements that come after it, not including itself.

Here's the corrected code:

def unique1(S):
  for j in range(len(S)):
    for k in range(j + 1, len(S)):
      if S[j] == S[k]:
        return False
  return True


#23 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Unique\mutation_2_line_no_4_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The code is checking if any two elements in the given list `S` are not equal, and if it finds such a pair, it immediately returns `False`. However, this logic is incorrect because it should only return `False` if there is at least one pair of elements that are equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition inside the inner loop. Instead of checking if the elements are not equal, we should check if they are equal. If we find any pair of equal elements, we can immediately return `False`. If we finish the loop without finding any equal pair, we can return `True`.

Here's the corrected code:

def unique1(S):
  for j in range(len(S)):
    for k in range(j+1, len(S)):
      if S[j] == S[k]:
        return False
  return True


#24 Tests_Final/Ch03/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Unique\mutation_3_line_no_4_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The code is checking if any two elements in the given list `S` are not equal, and if it finds such a pair, it immediately returns `False`. However, this logic is incorrect for determining if all elements in the list are unique.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition inside the inner loop. Instead of checking if `S[j] != S[k]`, we should check if `S[j] == S[k]`. If we find any pair of equal elements, we can immediately return `False`. If the inner loop completes without finding any equal elements, we can return `True` at the end.

Here's the corrected code:

def unique1(S):
  for j in range(len(S)):
    for k in range(j+1, len(S)):
      if S[j] == S[k]:
        return False
  return True
