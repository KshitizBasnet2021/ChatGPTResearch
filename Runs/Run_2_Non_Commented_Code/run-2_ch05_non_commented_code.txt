#1 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_1_line_no_5_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop condition, it should be `A[j - 1] > cur` instead of `A[j + 1] > cur`. 

Here's the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur

Now the code should work correctly.


#2 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_2_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop, when shifting elements to the right, the assignment `A[j] = A[j + 1]` should be `A[j] = A[j - 1]`. This will correctly shift the elements to the right. 

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > cur:
      A[j] = A[j - 1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur

Now the code should correctly perform the insertion sort algorithm.


#3 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_3_line_no_7_ASR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop, the variable `j` should be decremented (`j -= 1`) instead of incremented (`j += 1`) in order to shift the elements to the right. 

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > cur:
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur

Now the elements will be correctly shifted to the right during the insertion sort algorithm.


#4 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_4_line_no_5_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be "A[j - 1] > cur" instead of "not ((j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur))". 

Here's the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur:
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur

Now the code should correctly sort the list using the insertion sort algorithm.


#5 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_5_line_no_5_LCR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be "j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur" instead of "j > 0 or A[j - 1] > cur". 

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur

With this fix, the code should correctly sort the input list using the insertion sort algorithm.


#6 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_6_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `j > 0` instead of `j < 0`. 

Here's the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur

Now the code should work correctly.


#7 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_7_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The while loop condition should be `j > 0` instead of `j >= 0`. This is because we want to compare the current element with the previous element, and if `j` becomes 0, there is no previous element to compare with.

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur

Now the code should work correctly.


#8 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_8_line_no_5_ROR.py
The provided code is implementing an insertion sort algorithm. However, there is a bug in the code. The while loop condition should be checking if A[j - 1] > cur instead of A[j - 1] < cur. This is because we want to shift elements to the right until we find the correct position for the current element (cur) in the sorted portion of the array.

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur

Now the code should correctly sort the array in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.


#9 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_9_line_no_5_ROR.py
The provided code is missing proper indentation, but assuming that is just a formatting issue, there is no bug in the code. It correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm.
