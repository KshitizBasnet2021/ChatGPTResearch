#1 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_10_line_no_14_ASR.py
Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the corrected code:

def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1

I have fixed the following bugs:

1. In the line "else: else:i += 1", there is an extra "else" statement. I have removed it.

2. In the line "i -= 1" inside the "if k == 0" condition, I have corrected it to "i -= 1" instead of "i += 1". This is because we need to move backwards in the text string when a mismatch occurs.

With these fixes, the code should work correctly.


#2 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_11_line_no_15_ASR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. In the line `i -= 1`, it should be `i -= k` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= k
        k += 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```


#3 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_12_line_no_18_ASR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. In the line `i -= m - min(k, j + 1)`, the subtraction should be replaced with addition. The correct line should be `i += m - min(k, j + 1)`. 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1


#4 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_13_line_no_3_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The indentation of the code is incorrect, which will cause a syntax error. The line `last = {}` should be indented to be inside the `if not (m == 0):` block. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
    n, m = len(T), len(P)
    if not (m == 0):
        last = {}
        for k in range(m):
            last[P[k]] = k
        i = m - 1
        k = m - 1
        while i < n:
            if T[i] == P[k]:
                if k == 0:
                    return i
                else:
                    i -= 1
                    k -= 1
            else:
                j = last.get(T[i], -1)
                i += m - min(k, j + 1)
                k = m - 1
    return -1
```

Now the code should run without any syntax errors.


#5 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_14_line_no_10_COI.py
Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the fixed code:

def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    while k >= 0:
      if T[i] == P[k]:
        if k == 0:
          return i
        else:
          i -= 1
          k -= 1
      else:
        j = last.get(T[i], -1)
        i += m - min(k, j + 1)
        k = m - 1
    i += m
    k = m - 1
  return -1

The bugs in the original code were:
1. The condition in the inner while loop was incorrect. It should be "while k >= 0" instead of "while not (i < n)".
2. The check for matching characters in the inner while loop was missing. I added an if condition to check if T[i] is equal to P[k].
3. The calculation of the next index to compare was incorrect. It should be "i += m - min(k, j + 1)" instead of "i += m - min(k, j)".
4. After the inner while loop, the code should increment i by m and reset k to m-1 to continue searching for the next occurrence of P in T.


#6 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_15_line_no_11_COI.py
Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the fixed code:

def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1

I fixed the following bugs:

1. In the line "if not (T[i] == P[k]):", the condition is redundant and should be removed.

2. In the line "if k == 0:", we need to check if k has reached 0 to determine if we have found a match. If k is 0, it means we have matched all characters in P and can return the current index i.

3. In the line "i += m - min(k, j + 1)", we need to calculate the number of positions to shift the pattern P based on the last occurrence of the current character in T. The correct formula is "i += m - min(k, j + 1)".

With these fixes, the code should work correctly.


#7 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_16_line_no_12_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The line `if not (k == 0):` is unnecessary and should be removed. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```

This code implements the Boyer-Moore algorithm for string searching. It finds the first occurrence of pattern `P` in text `T` and returns the index of the first character of the match. If no match is found, it returns -1.


#8 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_17_line_no_3_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The indentation is incorrect, which causes a syntax error. The line `last = {}` should be indented to be inside the `if m != 0:` block. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
    n, m = len(T), len(P)
    if m != 0:
        last = {}
        for k in range(m):
            last[P[k]] = k
        i = m - 1
        k = m - 1
        while i < n:
            if T[i] == P[k]:
                if k == 0:
                    return i
                else:
                    i -= 1
                    k -= 1
            else:
                j = last.get(T[i], -1)
                i += m - min(k, j + 1)
                k = m - 1
    return -1
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#9 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_18_line_no_10_ROR.py
Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    while i >= 0:
      if T[i] == P[k]:
        if k == 0:
          return i
        else:
          i -= 1
          k -= 1
      else:
        break
    j = last.get(T[i+m], -1)
    i += m - min(k, j + 1)
    k = m - 1
  return -1
```

Here are the changes made:

1. In the inner while loop, the condition `while i > n` should be `while i >= 0` to ensure that we iterate over the characters of the text string correctly.
2. Inside the inner while loop, we need to check if the current characters match (`T[i] == P[k]`). If they do, we continue decrementing `i` and `k`. If they don't match, we break out of the loop.
3. In the line `j = last.get(T[i], -1)`, we need to check `T[i+m]` instead of `T[i]` to get the last occurrence of the character in the pattern.
4. Finally, we return -1 if no match is found.

With these fixes, the code should work correctly.


#10 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_19_line_no_10_ROR.py
Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
    n, m = len(T), len(P)
    if m == 0:
        return 0
    last = {}
    for k in range(m):
        last[P[k]] = k
    i = m - 1
    k = m - 1
    while i < n:
        while k >= 0:
            if T[i] == P[k]:
                if k == 0:
                    return i
                else:
                    i -= 1
                    k -= 1
            else:
                break
        j = last.get(T[i], -1)
        i += m - min(k, j + 1)
        k = m - 1
    return -1
```

Here are the changes made:

1. In the inner while loop, the condition `i <= n` should be `i >= 0` to iterate backwards through the string.
2. Added a check inside the inner while loop to compare `T[i]` with `P[k]` and break the loop if they are not equal.
3. Fixed the calculation of `i` in the outer while loop to correctly update the index.
4. Fixed the calculation of `k` in the outer while loop to reset it to `m - 1` after each iteration.


#11 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_1_line_no_17_AOD.py
The code provided is missing a check for the case when the pattern length is greater than the text length. This can lead to an index out of range error. To fix this, we can add a check at the beginning of the function to return -1 if the pattern length is greater than the text length.

Here's the updated code:

def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0 or m > n: return -1
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1

Now, if the pattern length is greater than the text length, the function will return -1.


#12 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_20_line_no_11_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the line `if T[i] != P[k]:`, it is checking if `T[i]` is not equal to `P[k]`, but this condition will never be true because it is already checked in the previous line `if T[i] == P[k]:`. 

To fix this bug, we can remove the line `if T[i] != P[k]:` and the corresponding `else` block. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```

Now, the code should work correctly.


#13 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_21_line_no_12_ROR.py
Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the fixed code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[P[k]] = k
  i = m - 1
  k = m - 1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```

Here are the changes made:

1. Added a return statement when a match is found at index `i` in the text `T`.
2. Removed the unnecessary `if k != 0` condition inside the `if k == 0` block.
3. Fixed the indentation of the `else` block inside the `if T[i] == P[k]` condition.

With these fixes, the code should work correctly.


#14 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_2_line_no_20_AOD.py
There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `i += m - min(k, j + 1)`. This line should be `i += max(1, k - j)`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += max(1, k - j)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```

This fix ensures that the algorithm moves the pattern P as far as possible to the right in the text T when a mismatch occurs.


#15 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_3_line_no_8_AOR.py
Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here are the fixes:

1. In the line `i = m-1`, it should be `i = m - 1` (with a space before the minus sign).

2. In the line `i = m + 1`, it should be `i = m - 1` (to initialize `i` correctly).

3. Inside the while loop, the line `i -= 1` should be moved outside the if-else condition, so that it is always executed.

4. The line `i += m - min(k, j + 1)` should be changed to `i += max(1, k - j)` to correctly calculate the jump distance.

Here's the corrected code:

def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[P[k]] = k
  i = m - 1
  while i < n:
    k = m - 1
    while k >= 0 and T[i] == P[k]:
      i -= 1
      k -= 1
    if k == -1:
      return i + 1
    j = last.get(T[i], -1)
    i += max(1, k - j)
  return -1


#16 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_4_line_no_9_AOR.py
Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[P[k]] = k
  i = m - 1
  k = m - 1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```

Here are the changes made:

1. Removed the extra line `k = m + 1` which was not needed.
2. Added a `while` loop to iterate through the text `T`.
3. Fixed the indentation of the `if` statement inside the loop.
4. Corrected the calculation of `i` and `k` when there is a mismatch.
5. Returned `-1` at the end if no match is found.

Now the code should work correctly for finding the pattern `P` in the text `T` using the Boyer-Moore algorithm.


#17 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_5_line_no_17_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the line `j = last.get(T[i], +1)`, the value `+1` should be `-1` instead. This is because if the character `T[i]` is not found in the `last` dictionary, it should return `-1` instead of `+1`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```

Now, the code should work correctly.


#18 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_6_line_no_18_AOR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. In the line `i += m + min(k, j + 1)`, the addition should be replaced with subtraction. The correct line should be `i -= m - min(k, j + 1)`. 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i -= m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1


#19 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_7_line_no_18_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the line `i += m - min(k, j - 1)`, the subtraction should be `j + 1` instead of `j - 1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```

This fix ensures that the algorithm correctly jumps to the next possible position in the text `T` when a mismatch occurs.


#20 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_8_line_no_19_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

In the else block, when there is a mismatch between T[i] and P[k], the code incorrectly sets k = m + 1 instead of k = m - 1. This will cause the algorithm to skip characters in the pattern P and potentially miss a match.

Here is the corrected code:

def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1


#21 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_9_line_no_20_AOR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `return +1`. It should be `return -1` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
```


#22 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_10_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be `k < m` instead of `k > m`. 

Here's the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1


#23 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_11_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The while loop condition should be modified to check if k is less than m instead of less than or equal to m. This is because the index k should only go up to m-1, as the indices of a string start from 0. 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1


#24 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_12_line_no_5_ROR.py
The provided code is a brute force algorithm for finding a pattern in a text. It searches for the pattern P in the text T and returns the index of the first occurrence of P in T. If the pattern is not found, it returns -1.

The code looks correct and there are no apparent bugs. However, there is one improvement that can be made to optimize the algorithm.

Currently, the code uses a nested loop to compare each character of the pattern P with the corresponding character in the text T. This results in a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.

To optimize the algorithm, we can use the "early exit" strategy. Instead of comparing each character of the pattern with the text, we can compare the entire pattern with a substring of the text. If the substring does not match the pattern, we can skip to the next substring without comparing individual characters.

Here's the updated code with the optimization:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    if T[i:i+m] == P:
      return i
  return -1

With this optimization, the time complexity of the algorithm is reduced to O(n), where n is the length of the text.


#25 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_13_line_no_7_ROR.py
The provided code is missing a closing parenthesis at the end of the function definition. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1
```

The bug was in the condition `if k != m`, which should be `if k == m` to check if the entire pattern has been matched.


#26 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_1_line_no_9_AOD.py
The code provided seems to have a bug in the return statement. 

Currently, the code returns 1 if no match is found. However, it would be more appropriate to return -1 to indicate that no match is found. 

Here's the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1


#27 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_2_line_no_3_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the range of the outer loop. The range should be `range(n - m + 1)` instead of `range((n + m) + 1)`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n - m + 1):
    k = 0
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1
```

This fix ensures that the outer loop does not go beyond the valid indices of `T` where the pattern `P` can be found.


#28 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_3_line_no_3_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the range of the for loop. The range should be (n - m + 1) instead of (n - m) - 1. 

Here's the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range((n - m) + 1):
    k = 0
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1


#29 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_4_line_no_5_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop condition, it should be `T[i + k] == P[k]` instead of `T[i - k] == P[k]`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1
```

This fix ensures that the characters in `T` and `P` are compared correctly.


#30 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_5_line_no_9_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The return statement at the end of the function should return -1 instead of +1 to indicate that the pattern was not found in the text. Here's the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1


#31 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_6_line_no_6_ASR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop, the variable `k` should be incremented instead of decremented. 

Here's the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1


#32 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_7_line_no_5_COI.py
The provided code has a bug in the while loop condition. The condition should be `k < m` instead of `k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while k < m:
      if T[i + k] != P[k]:
        break
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1
```

In the corrected code, the while loop checks if `k` is less than `m` and breaks if the characters at the corresponding positions in `T` and `P` are not equal. This ensures that the loop terminates correctly.


#33 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_8_line_no_7_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `if not (k == m)` should be changed to `if k == m` in order to correctly check if the pattern has been found. 

Here's the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1


#34 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Non_Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_9_line_no_5_LCR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The while loop condition should be modified to check if k is less than m and if the characters at T[i + k] and P[k] are equal. Additionally, the return statement should be modified to return the index i+k-m instead of just i.

Here is the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i+k-m
  return -1
