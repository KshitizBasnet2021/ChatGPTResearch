#1 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_10_line_no_16_ASR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `i += m - min(k, j + 1)`. This line is used to calculate the jump step when a mismatch occurs. However, the calculation is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line to `i += max(1, k - j)`. This will ensure that the jump step is at least 1, and it will correctly handle cases where the last occurrence of the mismatched character in the pattern is to the left of the current position in the text.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                   # introduce convenient notations
  if m == 0: return 0                     # trivial search for empty string
  last = {}                               # build 'last' dictionary
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k                      # later occurrence overwrites
  # align end of pattern at index m-1 of text
  i = m-1                                 # an index into T
  k = m-1                                 # an index into P
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:                      # a matching character
      if k == 0:
        return i                          # pattern begins at index i of text
      else:
        i += 1
        k -= 1                            # of both T and P
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)              # last(T[i]) is -1 if not found
      i += max(1, k - j)                  # case analysis for jump step
      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```

With this fix, the `find_boyer_moore` function should work correctly.


#2 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_11_line_no_17_ASR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. In the line `i += m - min(k, j + 1)`, the `min(k, j + 1)` should be replaced with `max(1, k - j)`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                   # introduce convenient notations
  if m == 0: return 0                     # trivial search for empty string
  last = {}                               # build 'last' dictionary
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k                      # later occurrence overwrites
  # align end of pattern at index m-1 of text
  i = m-1                                 # an index into T
  k = m-1                                 # an index into P
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:                      # a matching character
      if k == 0:
        return i                          # pattern begins at index i of text
      else:
        i -= 1                            # examine previous character
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)              # last(T[i]) is -1 if not found
      i += max(1, k - j)                  # case analysis for jump step
      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```

This fix ensures that the algorithm correctly jumps to the next possible match position when a mismatch occurs.


#3 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_12_line_no_20_ASR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. In the line `i -= m - min(k, j + 1)`, the subtraction should be replaced with addition. The correct line should be `i += m - min(k, j + 1)`. This bug causes the algorithm to skip characters in the text when a mismatch occurs.


#4 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_13_line_no_4_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The line `if not (m == 0):` is not properly indented and is causing a syntax error. 

To fix it, we need to indent the block of code that follows it. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                   # introduce convenient notations
  if not (m == 0):
    last = {}                               # build 'last' dictionary
    for k in range(m):
      last[ P[k] ] = k                      # later occurrence overwrites
    # align end of pattern at index m-1 of text
    i = m-1                                 # an index into T
    k = m-1                                 # an index into P
    while i < n:
      if T[i] == P[k]:                      # a matching character
        if k == 0:
          return i                          # pattern begins at index i of text
        else:
          i -= 1                            # examine previous character
          k -= 1                            # of both T and P
      else:
        j = last.get(T[i], -1)              # last(T[i]) is -1 if not found
        i += m - min(k, j + 1)              # case analysis for jump step
        k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```

Now the code should run without any syntax errors.


#5 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_14_line_no_11_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The while loop condition should be `while i < n` instead of `while not (i < n)`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                   # introduce convenient notations

  last = {}                               # build 'last' dictionary
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k                      # later occurrence overwrites
  # align end of pattern at index m-1 of text
  i = m-1                                 # an index into T
  k = m-1                                 # an index into P
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:                      # a matching character
      if k == 0:
        return i                          # pattern begins at index i of text
      else:
        i -= 1                            # examine previous character
        k -= 1                            # of both T and P
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)              # last(T[i]) is -1 if not found
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)              # case analysis for jump step
      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#6 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_15_line_no_12_COI.py
There is a bug in the provided code. The bug occurs when the character at index i in the text T does not match the character at index k in the pattern P, and k is not equal to 0. In this case, the code incorrectly decrements both i and k by 1. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the code to correctly handle this case. Instead of decrementing both i and k by 1, we should update i to the next index where the character at T[i] is equal to the last occurrence of P[k] in the pattern. This can be done by using the last dictionary to get the last occurrence of T[i] and updating i accordingly. 

Here is the corrected code:

Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `while i <= n:`. It should be `while i < n:` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

This fix ensures that the algorithm correctly jumps to the next possible match position when a mismatch occurs.

Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if k != 0:`. This condition should be `if k == 0:` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `return 1` at the end of the function. It should be `return -1` instead, to indicate that the substring P was not found in the text T.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                   # introduce convenient notations

    last[ P[k] ] = k                      # later occurrence overwrites
  # align end of pattern at index m-1 of text
  i = m-1                                 # an index into T
  k = m-1                                 # an index into P
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:                      # a matching character
      if k == 0:
        return i                          # pattern begins at index i of text
      else:
        i -= 1                            # examine previous character
        k -= 1                            # of both T and P
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)              # last(T[i]) is -1 if not found
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)              # case analysis for jump step
      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern

```

Now, if the substring P is not found in the text T, the function will correctly return -1.

Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if T[i] == P[k]:`. It should be `if T[i] == P[k-1]:` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):

      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```

In the corrected code, `if T[i] == P[k]:` has been changed to `if T[i] == P[k-1]:` to correctly compare the characters.


#17 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_5_line_no_19_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `j = last.get(T[i], +1)`. The second argument of the `get()` method should be `-1` instead of `+1`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                   # introduce convenient notations

    last[ P[k] ] = k                      # later occurrence overwrites
  # align end of pattern at index m-1 of text
  i = m-1                                 # an index into T
  k = m-1                                 # an index into P
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:                      # a matching character
      if k == 0:
        return i                          # pattern begins at index i of text
      else:
        i -= 1                            # examine previous character
        k -= 1                            # of both T and P
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)              # case analysis for jump step
      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#18 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_6_line_no_20_AOR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `i += m + min(k, j + 1)`. This line is used to calculate the number of positions to shift the pattern when a mismatch occurs. However, the calculation is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line to `i += max(1, k - j)`. This will ensure that we always shift the pattern at least one position to the right, even if the last occurrence of the mismatched character is before the current position.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                   # introduce convenient notations
  if m == 0: return 0                     # trivial search for empty string
  last = {}                               # build 'last' dictionary
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k                      # later occurrence overwrites
  # align end of pattern at index m-1 of text
  i = m-1                                 # an index into T
  k = m-1                                 # an index into P
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:                      # a matching character
      if k == 0:
        return i                          # pattern begins at index i of text
      else:
        i -= 1                            # examine previous character
        k -= 1                            # of both T and P
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)              # last(T[i]) is -1 if not found
      i += max(1, k - j)
      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```

With this fix, the `find_boyer_moore` function should work correctly.


#19 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_7_line_no_20_AOR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. In the line `i += m - min(k, j - 1)`, the subtraction should be `j + 1` instead of `j - 1`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""

      else:
        i -= 1                            # examine previous character

      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```

This fix ensures that the algorithm correctly jumps to the next possible match position when a mismatch occurs.

```


#21 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_boyer_moore\mutation_9_line_no_22_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the return statement at the end of the function. Instead of returning -1 when the pattern is not found, it returns +1. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the return statement from `return +1` to `return -1`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python

    last[ P[k] ] = k                      # later occurrence overwrites
  # align end of pattern at index m-1 of text
  i = m-1                                 # an index into T
  k = m-1                                 # an index into P

      k = m - 1                           # restart at end of pattern
  return -1
```


#22 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_10_line_no_6_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `k < m` instead of `k > m`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations
  for i in range(n-m+1):                     # try every potential starting index within T
    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):
      k += 1
    if k == m:                               # if we reached the end of pattern,
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i
```

In the original code, the while loop condition `k > m` would always be False because `k` is initially set to 0. As a result, the loop would never execute and the function would always return -1. By changing the condition to `k < m`, the loop will iterate until `k` reaches the length of pattern `P` or until a mismatch is found.


#23 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_11_line_no_6_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `k < m` instead of `k <= m`. This is because the index `k` should be less than the length of pattern `m` in order to access the elements of pattern `P`. 

Here is the corrected code:

The provided code is missing a colon at the end of the function definition. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations

    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while (k < m and T[i + k] != P[k]):
      k += 1

  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i
```

The code should now be free of syntax errors.


#25 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_13_line_no_8_ROR.py
The code provided seems to be correct and does not contain any bugs. It is a brute-force algorithm for finding the lowest index at which a substring P begins in a string T. The code iterates through all potential starting indices within T and checks if the characters match with the corresponding characters in P. If a match is found, it returns the starting index. If no match is found, it returns -1.


#26 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_1_line_no_10_AOD.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the return statement at the end of the function. 

The current code returns 1 instead of -1 when the substring P is not found in the string T. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the return statement from "return 1" to "return -1". 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations
  for i in range(n-m+1):                     # try every potential starting index within T
    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:        # kth character of P matches
      k += 1
    if k == m:                               # if we reached the end of pattern,
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1


#27 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_2_line_no_4_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the range of the for loop. The range should be from 0 to n - m + 1 instead of (n + m) + 1. 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations

    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:        # kth character of P matches
      k += 1
    if k == m:                               # if we reached the end of pattern,
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i


#28 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_3_line_no_4_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the range of the for loop. The range should be from 0 to (n - m) + 1, not from 0 to (n - m) - 1. 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations

    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:        # kth character of P matches
      k += 1
    if k == m:                               # if we reached the end of pattern,
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i


#29 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_4_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The while loop condition should be `k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]` instead of `k < m and T[i - k] == P[k]`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations
  for i in range(n-m+1):                     # try every potential starting index within T
    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):
      k += 1
    if k == m:                               # if we reached the end of pattern,
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#30 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_5_line_no_10_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The return statement at the end of the function should return -1 instead of +1. 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations

      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1


#31 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_6_line_no_7_ASR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

In the while loop, the variable `k` should be incremented by 1 instead of decremented by 1. 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations
  for i in range(n-m+1):                     # try every potential starting index within T
    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:        # kth character of P matches
      k += 1
    if k == m:                               # if we reached the end of pattern,
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i


#32 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_7_line_no_6_COI.py
The provided code has a bug. The while loop condition should be modified to check if k is less than m and if T[i + k] is equal to P[k]. Currently, the condition is checking if k is less than m and if T[i + k] is not equal to P[k]. 

Here's the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations
  for i in range(n-m+1):                     # try every potential starting index within T
    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:
      k += 1
    if k == m:                               # if we reached the end of pattern,
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i


#33 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_8_line_no_8_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the condition `if not (k == m):`. This condition should be `if k == m:` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations
  for i in range(n-m+1):                     # try every potential starting index within T
    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:        # kth character of P matches
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i
```

In the corrected code, the condition `if k == m:` checks if the entire pattern `P` has been matched. If it has, then it returns the starting index `i`.


#34 Tests_Final/Ch13/Mutation/Commented_Code\find_brute\mutation_9_line_no_6_LCR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be modified to ensure that it does not go out of bounds when accessing T[i + k] and P[k]. 

Here is the corrected code:

def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations
  for i in range(n-m+1):                     # try every potential starting index within T
    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):      # modified condition to prevent out of bounds access
      k += 1
    if k == m:                               # if we reached the end of pattern,
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i
