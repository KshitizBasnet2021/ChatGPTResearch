#1 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_1_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop condition, it should be `A[j] > cur` instead of `A[j + 1] > cur`. 

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while (j > 0 and A[j] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place


#2 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_2_line_no_7_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop, when shifting elements to the right, the assignment `A[j] = A[j + 1]` should be `A[j] = A[j - 1]` to correctly shift the elements to the right. 

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > cur:    # element A[j-1] must be after current
      A[j] = A[j - 1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place


#3 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_3_line_no_8_ASR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop, the variable j should be decremented by 1 instead of incremented by 1. 

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > cur:    # element A[j-1] must be after current
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place


#4 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_4_line_no_6_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be `while j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur:` instead of `while not ((j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur)):`.

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur:
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place


#5 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_5_line_no_6_LCR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be "j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur" instead of "j > 0 or A[j - 1] > cur". 

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place


#6 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_6_line_no_6_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur)` instead of `while (j < 0 and A[j - 1] > cur)`. 

Here's the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place


#7 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_7_line_no_6_ROR.py
The code provided is almost correct, but there is a small bug in the while loop condition. The condition should be `j > 0` instead of `j >= 0` to avoid accessing an index out of range when `j` is 0.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place
```

With this correction, the code should work correctly to sort the list `A` in non-decreasing order using the insertion sort algorithm.


#8 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_8_line_no_6_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The code is currently sorting the list in non-increasing order instead of non-decreasing order. To fix this, we need to change the condition in the while loop from `A[j - 1] < cur` to `A[j - 1] > cur`. 

Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place

Now the code will correctly sort the list in non-decreasing order.


#9 Tests_Final/Ch05/Mutation/Commented_Code\Insertion_Sort\mutation_9_line_no_6_ROR.py
The provided code is missing proper indentation. Here is the corrected code:

def insertion_sort(A):
    """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
    for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
        cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
        j = k                            # find correct index j for current
        while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] >= cur):
            A[j] = A[j-1]
            j -= 1
        A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place

The code itself looks correct and should work as intended. It implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of comparable elements in non-decreasing order.
