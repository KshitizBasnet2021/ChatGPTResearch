#1 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_10_line_no_6_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `if low >= high` should be `if low > high` in order to correctly handle the case when the interval is empty. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
```

This fix ensures that the binary search algorithm terminates correctly when the target is not found in the list.


#2 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_11_line_no_10_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if target != data[mid]:`. It should be `if target == data[mid]:` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
```


#3 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_12_line_no_12_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the recursive calls to `binary_search` when the target is greater than the middle element. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the recursive calls to `binary_search` as follows:

```python
# recur on the portion right of the middle
return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
```

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target > data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
    else:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
```

Now the recursive calls are correctly updating the low and high indices based on the target value.


#4 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_13_line_no_12_ROR.py
The provided code is missing a base case for when the target is not found in the list. To fix this, we can add a return statement at the end of the function to return False if none of the conditions are met. Here's the updated code:

def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target <= data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
  
  return False  # target not found in the list


#5 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_1_line_no_9_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the middle index. 

The line `mid = (low - high) // 2` should be changed to `mid = (low + high) // 2`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#6 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_2_line_no_9_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line where the middle index is calculated:

mid = (low + high) / 2

In Python 3.x, the division operator (/) performs floating-point division, which may result in a float value. However, the binary search algorithm requires an integer value for the middle index.

To fix this bug, we can use the integer division operator (//) instead:

mid = (low + high) // 2

This will ensure that the middle index is always an integer value.

Here is the corrected code:

def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)


#7 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_3_line_no_9_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the middle index. Instead of `(low + high) * 2`, it should be `(low + high) // 2` to find the middle index correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
```

Now the code should work correctly for binary search.


#8 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_4_line_no_14_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the recursive calls to `binary_search` when the target is less than `data[mid]`. The correct logic should be to recur on the portion left of the middle, so the recursive call should be `binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)` instead of `binary_search(data, target, low, mid + 1)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
```

Now the recursive calls will correctly search the left or right portion of the list based on the target value.


#9 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_5_line_no_17_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

In the recursive calls to `binary_search`, the parameters `low` and `high` are not updated correctly. 

To fix this, we need to update the parameters as follows:

- When `target < data[mid]`, we should search in the left portion of the list, so the recursive call should be `binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)`.
- When `target > data[mid]`, we should search in the right portion of the list, so the recursive call should be `binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:
    return False                    # interval is empty; no match
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
```

Now the recursive calls will update the `low` and `high` parameters correctly, ensuring that the search is performed on the correct portion of the list.


#10 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_6_line_no_6_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the condition `if not (low > high):`. This condition should be `if low > high:` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if not (target == data[mid]):`. The condition should be `if target != data[mid]:` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

```


#12 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_8_line_no_12_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the recursive calls to `binary_search` when the target is not found. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the conditions for the recursive calls. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

  The search only considers the portion from data[low] to data[high] inclusive.
  """
  if low > high:

  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      # recur on the portion left of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
```

In the original code, the condition for the recursive call on the left portion was `not (target < data[mid])`, which is incorrect. The correct condition is `target < data[mid]`.


#13 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search\mutation_9_line_no_6_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the condition `if low < high:`. It should be `if low <= high:` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  """Return True if target is found in indicated portion of a Python list.

    else:
      # recur on the portion right of the middle
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)


#14 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_10_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be `low <= high` instead of `low >= high`. 

Here's the corrected code:

  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:

#15 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_11_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the while loop condition. The condition should be `low <= high` instead of `low < high`. This is because when `low` and `high` are equal, there is still one element left to be checked. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  """Return True if target is found in the given Python list."""
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      high = mid - 1                # only consider values left of mid
    else:
      low = mid + 1                 # only consider values right of mid
  return False                      # loop ended without success
```

Now the binary search algorithm should work correctly.


#16 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_12_line_no_7_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if target != data[mid]:`. This line should be checking if the target is equal to `data[mid]` instead of not equal to `data[mid]`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  """Return True if target is found in the given Python list."""
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      high = mid - 1                # only consider values left of mid
    else:

  return False                      # loop ended without success
```

Now, the code will correctly return `True` if the target is found in the list and `False` otherwise.


#17 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_13_line_no_9_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the lines where the values of `high` and `low` are updated.

To fix the bug, we need to update the values of `high` and `low` correctly. 

Here is the corrected code:

Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the initialization of the `high` variable. It should be initialized to `len(data) - 1` instead of `len(data) + 1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

#20 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_2_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the middle index. 

The line `mid = (low - high) // 2` should be changed to `mid = (low + high) // 2`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python

```

Now the code should work correctly.


#21 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_3_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line where the middle index is calculated:

mid = (low + high) / 2

In Python 3.x, the division operator (/) performs floating-point division, which can result in a float value for the middle index. However, the list indices in Python must be integers.

To fix this bug, we can use the integer division operator (//) instead:

mid = (low + high) // 2

This will ensure that the middle index is always an integer.


#22 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_4_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the middle index (mid) inside the while loop. The correct calculation should be (low + high) // 2 instead of (low + high) * 2.

Here is the corrected code:

#23 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_5_line_no_10_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the line `high = mid + 1` inside the `elif` statement, it should be `high = mid - 1` instead. This is because if the target is less than the value at the middle index, we should update the `high` index to be one less than the middle index, not one more.

Here is the corrected code:

#25 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_7_line_no_5_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be `while low <= high` instead of `while not (low <= high)`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  """Return True if target is found in the given Python list."""
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      high = mid - 1                # only consider values left of mid
    else:
      low = mid + 1                 # only consider values right of mid
  return False                      # loop ended without success
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#26 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_8_line_no_7_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if not (target == data[mid]):`. This condition should be checking if the target is equal to the data[mid], but instead it is checking if the target is not equal to the data[mid]. 

To fix this bug, we can change the condition to `if target == data[mid]:`. 

Here is the corrected code:

def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  """Return True if target is found in the given Python list."""
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      high = mid - 1                # only consider values left of mid
    else:
      low = mid + 1                 # only consider values right of mid
  return False                      # loop ended without success


#27 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Search_iterative\mutation_9_line_no_9_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the `elif` statement should be `target > data[mid]` instead of `not (target < data[mid])`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  """Return True if target is found in the given Python list."""
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target > data[mid]:
      low = mid + 1                 # only consider values right of mid
    else:
      high = mid - 1                # only consider values left of mid
  return False                      # loop ended without success
```

In the corrected code, the `elif` condition checks if the target is greater than the middle element, and if so, updates the `low` variable to `mid + 1` to only consider values to the right of the middle element.


#28 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_10_line_no_5_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `elif start != stop - 1:` is incorrect. It should be `elif start != stop:` to handle the case when there is only one element in the slice.

Here is the corrected code:

def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start != stop:
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)


#29 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_1_line_no_5_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the line `elif start == stop + 1:`. This condition should be `elif start == stop:` because if `start` is equal to `stop + 1`, it means that there are no elements in the slice and we should return 0. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start == stop:
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#30 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_2_line_no_8_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the midpoint (mid) in the recursive calls to binary_sum. 

The correct calculation of the midpoint should be:
mid = (start + stop) // 2

Here is the corrected code:

def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:                  # one element in slice
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)


#31 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_3_line_no_8_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The line `mid = (start + stop) / 2` is using integer division, which will result in a truncated value for `mid`. This will cause the function to enter an infinite recursion loop when the slice has more than two elements.

To fix this bug, we can use the floor division operator `//` instead of the regular division operator `/`. This will ensure that `mid` is always an integer value.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:                  # one element in slice
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
```

With this fix, the function should work correctly.


#32 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_4_line_no_8_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the midpoint (mid) in the recursive calls to binary_sum. 

The correct calculation of the midpoint should be (start + stop) // 2, which finds the index of the middle element in the slice. 

Here is the corrected code:

def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:                  # one element in slice
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)


#33 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_5_line_no_9_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the recursive calls to `binary_sum` function. 

The correct implementation of the `binary_sum` function should be as follows:

```python
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:                  # one element in slice
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
```

In the else block, the recursive calls to `binary_sum` should be added instead of subtracted. This is because we want to calculate the sum of the numbers in the slice, not the difference.


#34 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_6_line_no_3_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the if statement is incorrect. It should be `if not (start < stop):` instead of `if not (start >= stop):`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if not (start < stop):
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:                  # one element in slice
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
```

This fix ensures that the function returns 0 when the start index is greater than or equal to the stop index, indicating an empty slice.


#35 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_7_line_no_5_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the elif statement is incorrect. It should be "if start == stop - 1" instead of "if not (start == stop - 1)". 

Here is the corrected code:

def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start == stop - 1:
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)


#36 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_8_line_no_3_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `if start <= stop` should be `if start >= stop` to correctly check if the slice is empty. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:                  # one element in slice
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
```

This fix ensures that the function returns 0 when the slice is empty, and correctly calculates the sum of the numbers in the slice otherwise.


#37 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Binary_Sum\mutation_9_line_no_3_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `start > stop` should be `start >= stop` in order to handle the case when `start` and `stop` are equal. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:                  # one element in slice
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
```

This fix ensures that when `start` and `stop` are equal, the function returns 0, indicating an empty slice.


#38 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Disk_Usage\mutation_1_line_no_9_ASR.py
There is a bug in the provided code. When calculating the total disk usage for a directory, the code subtracts the disk usage of each child from the total. However, this subtraction should only occur if the child is a directory. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the child is a directory before subtracting its disk usage from the total. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

def disk_usage(path):
  """Return the number of bytes used by a file/folder and any descendents."""
  total = os.path.getsize(path)                  # account for direct usage
  if os.path.isdir(path):                        # if this is a directory,
    for filename in os.listdir(path):            # then for each child:
      childpath = os.path.join(path, filename)   # compose full path to child
      if os.path.isdir(childpath):               # check if child is a directory
        total -= disk_usage(childpath)

  print ('{0:<7}'.format(total), path)           # descriptive output (optional)
  return total                                   # return the grand total
```

With this fix, the code will correctly calculate the disk usage for directories and files.


#39 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Disk_Usage\mutation_2_line_no_6_COI.py
There is a bug in the provided code. When checking if a path is a directory, the code uses `os.path.isdir(path)`. However, this check should be done before getting the size of the path using `os.path.getsize(path)`. 

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import os

def disk_usage(path):
  """Return the number of bytes used by a file/folder and any descendents."""
  if os.path.isdir(path):
    total = 0
    for filename in os.listdir(path):            # then for each child:
      childpath = os.path.join(path, filename)   # compose full path to child
      total += disk_usage(childpath)             # add child's usage to total
  else:
    total = os.path.getsize(path)                  # account for direct usage

  print ('{0:<7}'.format(total), path)           # descriptive output (optional)
  return total                                   # return the grand total
```

In the fixed code, the check for directory is done first, and if it is a directory, the code recursively calculates the total size of all its children. If it is not a directory, the code directly gets the size of the path.


#40 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_10_line_no_3_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the if statement at the beginning of the function. The condition should be "if n == 0" instead of "if not (n == 0)". 

Here is the corrected code:

def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result


#41 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_11_line_no_8_COI.py
The provided code is correct and does not contain any bugs. It correctly computes the value of x raised to the power of n using a recursive approach.


#42 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_12_line_no_3_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the if statement is incorrect. It should be `if n == 0` instead of `if n != 0`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
```

This code correctly computes the value of `x` raised to the power of `n` for integer `n`.


#43 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_13_line_no_8_ROR.py
The provided code is missing a base case for when n is negative. To fix this, we can add a condition to check if n is less than 0 and return 1 divided by the result of power(x, -n). This will handle negative exponents correctly.

Here's the updated code:

def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  elif n < 0:
    return 1 / power(x, -n)
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 != 1:
      result *= x                       
    return result


#44 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_1_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `partial = power(x, n / 2)`. The division operator `/` performs floating-point division in Python, which means that `n / 2` will always result in a float value, even if `n` is an integer. 

To fix this bug, we can use the integer division operator `//` instead, which performs integer division and returns an integer result. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
```

Now, the code will correctly compute the value `x**n` for integer `n`.


#45 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_2_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the recursive call to the power function. Instead of multiplying `x` by itself `n * 2` times, it should be multiplied `x` by itself `n // 2` times.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
```

This code will correctly compute the value `x**n` for any integer `n`.


#46 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_3_line_no_7_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `result = partial / partial`. This line should be `result = partial * partial` instead. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
```

Now the code should correctly compute the value `x**n` for integer `n`.


#47 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_4_line_no_7_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the line `result = partial // partial`. This line is supposed to calculate the result of `x**n` by multiplying `partial` with itself. However, using the `//` operator performs integer division, which will always result in 1. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the line to `result = partial * partial`. This will correctly calculate the result of `x**n` by multiplying `partial` with itself. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#48 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_5_line_no_7_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `result = partial ** partial`. It should be `result = partial * partial` instead. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
```

This fix ensures that the correct power is calculated by multiplying the partial result with itself, rather than raising it to the power of itself.


#49 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_6_line_no_8_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `if n * 2 == 1` is incorrect and will not work as intended. 

To fix it, we can change the condition to `if n % 2 == 1` to check if `n` is odd. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:
      result *= x                       
    return result
```

This updated code will correctly handle both even and odd values of `n`.


#50 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_7_line_no_9_ASR.py
The code provided is correct and does not contain any bugs. It correctly computes the value of x raised to the power of n using a recursive approach.


#51 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_8_line_no_9_ASR.py
The provided code is correct and does not contain any bugs. It correctly computes the value of x raised to the power of n using a recursive approach.


#52 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Power_Fast\mutation_9_line_no_9_ASR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The line `result **= x` should be `result *= x` to correctly include the extra factor of x when n is odd. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x
    return result
```

Now the code should work correctly.


#53 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse\mutation_1_line_no_3_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The base case condition in the recursive function is incorrect. It should be `start < stop` instead of `start < stop + 1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def reverse(S, start, stop):
  """Reverse elements in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start < stop:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    reverse(S, start+1, stop-1)                # recur on rest
```

This code will correctly reverse the elements in the given slice `S[start:stop]`.


#54 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse\mutation_2_line_no_4_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the line `(S[start], S[stop + 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])`. 

To fix the bug, we need to change it to `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def reverse(S, start, stop):
  """Reverse elements in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start < stop - 1:                         # if at least 2 elements:
    (S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])
    reverse(S, start+1, stop-1)                # recur on rest
```


#55 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse\mutation_3_line_no_4_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 

The bug is in the line `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop + 1], S[start])`. 

To fix the bug, we need to swap the elements correctly. The correct line should be `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def reverse(S, start, stop):
  """Reverse elements in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start < stop - 1:                         # if at least 2 elements:
    (S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])
    reverse(S, start+1, stop-1)                # recur on rest
```


#56 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse\mutation_4_line_no_5_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The recursive call to `reverse` should have `start` and `stop` as arguments, not `start - 1` and `stop - 1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def reverse(S, start, stop):
  """Reverse elements in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start < stop - 1:                         # if at least 2 elements:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    reverse(S, start + 1, stop - 1)
```

In the corrected code, the recursive call to `reverse` swaps the elements at `start` and `stop-1`, and then recursively calls `reverse` with `start + 1` and `stop - 1` as arguments. This ensures that the slice being reversed is gradually reduced until it reaches the base case of having only one element or no elements left.


#57 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse\mutation_5_line_no_5_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The recursive call to `reverse` should have `stop - 1` as the second argument instead of `stop + 1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def reverse(S, start, stop):
  """Reverse elements in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start < stop - 1:                         # if at least 2 elements:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    reverse(S, start + 1, stop - 1)
```

This fix ensures that the recursive call reduces the size of the slice by 1 in each iteration, eventually reaching the base case when `start` is equal to or greater than `stop - 1`.


#58 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse\mutation_6_line_no_3_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The base case for the recursion is missing, which can lead to an infinite recursion if the start and stop indices are not properly defined.

To fix the bug, we need to add a base case that stops the recursion when the start index is greater than or equal to the stop index. Here's the corrected code:

def reverse(S, start, stop):
  """Reverse elements in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop - 1:
    return  # base case, stop recursion
  S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
  reverse(S, start+1, stop-1)                # recur on rest

With this fix, the function will correctly reverse the elements in the given slice.


#59 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse\mutation_7_line_no_3_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The base case for the recursion is missing, which can lead to an infinite recursion. To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if the start index is greater than or equal to the stop index. If it is, we can simply return without making any changes.

Here's the corrected code:

def reverse(S, start, stop):
  """Reverse elements in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop - 1:
    return  # base case, return if start >= stop

  S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
  reverse(S, start+1, stop-1)                # recur on rest


#60 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse\mutation_8_line_no_3_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `start <= stop - 1` should be `start < stop - 1` to ensure that the function stops when `start` and `stop` are equal. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def reverse(S, start, stop):
  """Reverse elements in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start < stop - 1:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    reverse(S, start+1, stop-1)                # recur on rest
```

This will fix the bug and ensure that the function stops when `start` and `stop` are equal.


#61 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse_Iterative\mutation_1_line_no_4_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `start < stop`, not `start < stop + 1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1          # narrow the range

This will correctly reverse the elements in the sequence.


#62 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse_Iterative\mutation_2_line_no_5_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The line `(S[start], S[stop + 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])` is incorrect. It should be `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    (S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1          # narrow the range
```

This code will correctly reverse the elements in the sequence `S`.


#63 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse_Iterative\mutation_3_line_no_5_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The assignment statement `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop + 1], S[start])` is incorrect. It should be `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])` to correctly swap the elements at the start and stop indices.

Here is the corrected code:

def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    (S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1          # narrow the range

Now the code should correctly reverse the elements in the sequence.


#64 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse_Iterative\mutation_4_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The start and stop indices are being updated incorrectly in each iteration of the while loop. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the start and stop indices as follows:

start = start + 1
stop = stop - 1

Here is the corrected code:

def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    start = start + 1
    stop = stop - 1

Now the code should correctly reverse the elements in the sequence S.


#65 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse_Iterative\mutation_5_line_no_6_AOR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The stop variable should be decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop, not incremented. 

Here is the corrected code:

def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    (start, stop) = (start + 1, stop - 1)  # decrement stop by 1

Now the code should correctly reverse the elements in the sequence S.


#66 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse_Iterative\mutation_6_line_no_4_COI.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be `start < stop - 1` instead of `not (start < stop - 1)`. 

Here is the corrected code:

def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1          # narrow the range

This code will correctly reverse the elements in the sequence `S`.


#67 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse_Iterative\mutation_7_line_no_4_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be `start < stop - 1` instead of `start > stop - 1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1          # narrow the range

This code will correctly reverse the elements in the sequence `S`.


#68 Tests_Final/Ch04/Mutation/Commented_Code\Reverse_Iterative\mutation_8_line_no_4_ROR.py
Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the while loop condition. The condition should be `start < stop - 1` instead of `start <= stop - 1`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1          # narrow the range
```

This fix ensures that the loop stops when `start` is equal to `stop - 1`, which is the middle element in the sequence.
