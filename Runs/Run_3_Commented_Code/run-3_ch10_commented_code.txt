#1 Tests_Final/Ch10/Mutation/Commented_Code\Word_Frequency\mutation_1_line_no_7_AOR.py

No, there are no bugs in the provided code.


#2 Tests_Final/Ch10/Mutation/Commented_Code\Word_Frequency\mutation_2_line_no_6_COI.py

Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The code should increment the frequency of the word if it already exists in the dictionary, but the code is currently setting the frequency to 1 if the word already exists. 

To fix this bug, the code should be changed to:

def find_most_frequent_word(filename):
  freq = {}
  with open(filename) as file:
    for piece in file.read().lower().split():
      word = ''.join(c for c in piece if c.isalpha())
      if word:
        freq[word] = 1 + freq.get(word, 0)

  max_word = ''
  max_count = 0
  for (w, c) in freq.items():
    if c > max_count:
      max_word = w
      max_count = c

  return max_word, max_count


#3 Tests_Final/Ch10/Mutation/Commented_Code\Word_Frequency\mutation_3_line_no_12_COI.py

No, there are no bugs in the provided code.


#4 Tests_Final/Ch10/Mutation/Commented_Code\Word_Frequency\mutation_4_line_no_12_ROR.py

Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The code should be changed to:

def find_most_frequent_word(filename):
  freq = {}
  with open(filename) as file:
    for piece in file.read().lower().split():
      word = ''.join(c for c in piece if c.isalpha())
      if word:
        freq[word] = 1 + freq.get(word, 0)

  max_word = ''
  max_count = 0
  for (w, c) in freq.items():
    if c > max_count:
      max_word = w
      max_count = c

  return max_word, max_count


#5 Tests_Final/Ch10/Mutation/Commented_Code\Word_Frequency\mutation_5_line_no_12_ROR.py
