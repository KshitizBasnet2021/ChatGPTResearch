#possible_change.py
#
#The provided code is a recursive function that calculates the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a list of coin denominations. However, there is a bug in the code. 
#
#The bug is in the line `lIIlIIlIIII, *IIIIlllIIlIII = lIlIIIlIllIlIIl`. This line is trying to assign the first element of the list `lIlIIIlIllIlIIl` to the variable `lIIlIIlIIII`, and the rest of the elements to the variable `IIIIlllIIlIII`. However, the code is using the wrong variable names. 
#
#To fix the bug, you need to change the variable names in that line to match the variable names used in the rest of the code. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def possible_change(lIlIIIlIllIlIIl, llIlIIIIIlIlllIII):
    if llIlIIIIIlIlllIII == 0:
        return 1
    if llIlIIIIIlIlllIII < 0:
        return 0
    lIIlIIlIIII, *IIIIlllIIlIII = lIlIIIlIllIlIIl
    return IllllIllIIllIlIIllll(IIIIlllIIlIII, llIlIIIIIlIlllIII - lIIlIIlIIII) + IllllIllIIllIlIIllll(lIlIIIlIllIlIIl, llIlIIIIIlIlllIII)
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly.
