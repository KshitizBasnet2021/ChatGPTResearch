#longest_common_subsequence.py
#
#The provided code is a recursive function that finds the longest common substring between two strings. It compares the first characters of the two strings and recursively calls itself with the remaining characters of each string.
#
#There is no bug in the code. It is a correct implementation of the longest common substring algorithm.
