#minimum_spanning_tree.py
#
#The code provided seems to be implementing the Union-Find algorithm to find connected components in a graph. However, there is a bug in the code that needs to be fixed.
#
#The bug is in the line `if lIIIlIIIlllIIIlII.setdefault(IlllIlllll, {IlllIlllll}) != lIIIlIIIlllIIIlII.setdefault(lIIlIIll, {lIIlIIll}):`. The `setdefault` method is used to set a default value for a key if it doesn't exist in the dictionary. However, in this case, it is also updating the value for the key, which is not what we want.
#
#To fix this bug, we can use the `get` method instead of `setdefault` to retrieve the value for a key. If the key doesn't exist, we can set the default value as an empty set.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def minimum_spanning_tree(graph):
    connected_components = set()
    parent = {}
#
    for edge in sorted(graph, key=graph.__getitem__):
        node1, node2 = edge
        parent.setdefault(node1, node1)
        parent.setdefault(node2, node2)
#
        if find_parent(node1, parent) != find_parent(node2, parent):
            connected_components.add(edge)
            union(node1, node2, parent)
#
    return connected_components
#
def minimum_spanning_tree(node, parent):
    if parent[node] != node:
        parent[node] = find_parent(parent[node], parent)
    return parent[node]
#
def minimum_spanning_tree(node1, node2, parent):
    parent[find_parent(node2, parent)] = find_parent(node1, parent)
#
#I have also refactored the code to use separate functions for finding the parent and performing the union operation. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand.
