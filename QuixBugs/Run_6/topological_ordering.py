#
#There is a bug in the provided code. The variable `incoming_nodes` and `outgoing_nodes` are not defined. To fix this, you need to define these variables and modify the code accordingly. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def topological_ordering(llIIllIllIl):
    lIIllIIlI = [IlllIIIIllIIllI for IlllIIIIllIIllI in llIIllIllIl if not IlllIIIIllIIllI.incoming_nodes]
    for IlllIIIIllIIllI in lIIllIIlI:
        for llllllllIllllIlIII in IlllIIIIllIIllI.outgoing_nodes:
            if set(lIIllIIlI).issuperset(llllllllIllllIlIII.outgoing_nodes) and llllllllIllllIlIII not in lIIllIIlI:
                lIIllIIlI.append(llllllllIllllIlIII)
    return lIIllIIlI
#```
#
#Please note that you need to define the `incoming_nodes` and `outgoing_nodes` variables according to your specific use case.
