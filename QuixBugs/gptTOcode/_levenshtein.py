#
#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `return len(source) or len(target)`. This line is incorrect because it uses the logical OR operator (`or`) instead of the conditional operator (`if`). 
#
#To fix the bug, we need to change the line to use the conditional operator. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def levenshtein(source, target):
    if source == '' or target == '':
        return len(source) if source else len(target)
#
    elif source[0] == target[0]:
        return 1 + levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])
#
    else:
        return 1 + min(
            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target)
        )
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly and calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings.
