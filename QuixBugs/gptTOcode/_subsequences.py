#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the range of the for loop. The range should be `range(a, b + 1)` instead of `range(a, b + 1 - k)`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
#
    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        ret.extend(
            [i] + rest for rest in subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)
        )
#
    return ret
#```
#
#This code will correctly generate all length-k ascending sequences of integers in the range(a, b).
