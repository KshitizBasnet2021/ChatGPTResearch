#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `n ^= n - 1`. 
#
#To fix the bug, we need to change `n ^= n - 1` to `n &= n - 1`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def bitcount(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        n &= n - 1
        count += 1
    return count
#```
#
#This code uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to clear the rightmost 1-bit in `n`. This operation effectively removes the rightmost 1-bit from `n` in each iteration of the loop, allowing us to count the number of 1-bits in `n`.
