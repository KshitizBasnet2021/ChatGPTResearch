#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the second for loop, when enumerating `arr`, the loop variable `count` should be assigned to `counts[i]` instead of `arr[i]`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def bucketsort(arr, k):
    counts = [0] * k
    for x in arr:
        counts[x] += 1
#
    sorted_arr = []
    for i, count in enumerate(counts):
        sorted_arr.extend([i] * count)
#
    return sorted_arr
#```
#
#This fix ensures that the elements are sorted based on the counts of each element in the `arr` list.
