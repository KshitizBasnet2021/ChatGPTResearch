#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:`. 
#
#The `issuperset()` method checks if all elements in the specified set are present in the calling set. However, in this case, we want to check if all elements in `nextnode.outgoing_nodes` are present in `ordered_nodes`. So, we need to change `issuperset()` to `issubset()`.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
#
    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if set(ordered_nodes).issubset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
#
    return ordered_nodes
#```
#
#This will ensure that the code correctly checks if all outgoing nodes of `nextnode` are present in `ordered_nodes` before adding it to the `ordered_nodes` list.
