#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `yield flatten(x)`. It should be `yield x` instead. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x
#```
#
#This code will correctly flatten a nested list into a single list.
