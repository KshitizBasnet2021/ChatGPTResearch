#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if any(n % p > 0 for p in primes):`. This line incorrectly checks if `n` is divisible by any prime number in the `primes` list. It should actually check if `n` is divisible by any prime number up to the square root of `n`.
#
#To fix this bug, we can modify the line to `if any(n % p == 0 for p in primes if p * p <= n):`. This will correctly check if `n` is divisible by any prime number up to the square root of `n`.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def sieve(max):
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, max + 1):
        if any(n % p == 0 for p in primes if p * p <= n):
            primes.append(n)
    return primes
