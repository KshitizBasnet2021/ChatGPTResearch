#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line where the helper peg is determined. The code uses the set difference operation to find the helper peg, but it is not guaranteed to always return the same peg. This can lead to incorrect moves in the solution.
#
#To fix this bug, we can modify the code to use the remaining peg as the helper peg. Here's the corrected code:
#
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start, end}).pop()
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end))
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))
#
    return steps
#
#Now, the code correctly determines the helper peg by finding the remaining peg after excluding the start and end pegs.
