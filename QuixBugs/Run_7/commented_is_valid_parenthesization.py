#is_valid_parenthesization.py
#
#The provided code appears to be correct and does not contain any bugs. It correctly checks if the parentheses are properly nested by incrementing a counter for each opening parenthesis and decrementing it for each closing parenthesis. If the counter becomes negative at any point, it means there are more closing parentheses than opening parentheses, and the function returns False. Otherwise, if the counter is zero at the end, it means all parentheses are properly nested, and the function returns True.
