#shortest_path_lengths.py
#
#The code provided is implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path lengths between all pairs of vertices in a graph. However, there is a bug in the code that needs to be fixed.
#
#The bug is in the innermost loop where the shortest path lengths are updated. The current implementation is incorrect because it is using the wrong indices for updating the lengths. The correct indices should be `i, j` instead of `i, k` and `j, k`.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
#from collections import defaultdict
#
def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)
#
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
                )
#
    return length_by_path
#```
#
#With this fix, the code should correctly compute the shortest path lengths between all pairs of vertices in the graph.
