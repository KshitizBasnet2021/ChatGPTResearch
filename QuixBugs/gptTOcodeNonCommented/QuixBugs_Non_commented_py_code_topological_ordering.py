#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:`. 
#
#The bug is that it is checking if the set of ordered nodes is a superset of the outgoing nodes of the next node. However, it should be checking if the set of ordered nodes is a superset of the incoming nodes of the next node. 
#
#To fix this bug, we need to change `nextnode.outgoing_nodes` to `nextnode.incoming_nodes` in the condition. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
#
    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
#
    return ordered_nodes
