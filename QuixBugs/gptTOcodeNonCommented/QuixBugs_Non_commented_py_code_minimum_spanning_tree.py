#minimum_spanning_tree.py
#
#The code provided is missing a closing parenthesis at the end of the function definition. Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):
    group_by_node = {}
    mst_edges = set()
#
    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.__getitem__):
        u, v = edge
        if group_by_node.setdefault(u, {u}) != group_by_node.setdefault(v, {v}):
            mst_edges.add(edge)
            group_by_node[u].update(group_by_node[v])
            for node in group_by_node[v]:
                group_by_node[node].update(group_by_node[u])
#
    return mst_edges
#```
#
#Other than that, the code looks fine. It implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph based on the weights of the edges.
