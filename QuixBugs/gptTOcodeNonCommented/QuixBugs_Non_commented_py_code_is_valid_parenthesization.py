#is_valid_parenthesization.py
#
#The provided code has a bug. It only checks if the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of closing parentheses, but it does not check if they are in the correct order.
#
#To fix this, we can modify the code to use a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses. Whenever we encounter a closing parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is not the corresponding opening parenthesis. If either of these conditions is true, we return False. After iterating through all the parentheses, we also need to check if the stack is empty. If it is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening parentheses, so we return False.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def is_valid_parenthesization(parens):
    stack = []
    for paren in parens:
        if paren == '(':
            stack.append(paren)
        else:
            if not stack or stack[-1] != '(':
                return False
            stack.pop()
#
    return len(stack) == 0
