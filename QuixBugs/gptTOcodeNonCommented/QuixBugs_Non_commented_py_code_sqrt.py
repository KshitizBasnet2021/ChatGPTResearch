#sqrt.py
#
#The code you provided is an implementation of the Babylonian method for finding the square root of a number. It looks correct and does not have any obvious bugs.
#
#However, there is one potential issue with the code. If the input value of `x` is negative, the code will still run and return a result. However, the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system. To handle this case, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to return an error message if `x` is negative.
#
#Here's an updated version of the code that includes this check:
#
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    if x < 0:
        return "Error: Cannot calculate square root of a negative number"
    
    approx = x / 2
    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:
        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)
    
    return approx
