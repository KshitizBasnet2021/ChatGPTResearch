#longest_common_subsequence.py
#
#The provided code is missing a base case for when both strings are empty. Additionally, the code does not handle the case when the lengths of the two strings are not equal. Here's an updated version of the code that addresses these issues:
#
#```python
def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return ''
#
    if a[0] == b[0]:
        return a[0] + longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:])
#
    return max(
        longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]),
        longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b),
        key=len
    )
#```
#
#This updated code includes a base case for when both strings are empty, and it compares the first characters of both strings to determine the longest common subsequence.
