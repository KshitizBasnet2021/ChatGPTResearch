#to_base.py
#
#The code provided seems to be correct and does not contain any bugs. It defines a function `to_base` that takes in a number `num` and a base `b`, and converts the number to the specified base using the digits and uppercase letters of the alphabet as the symbols.
#
#The code uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the number by the base and append the corresponding symbol to the result string. It continues until the number becomes 0.
#
#The code also imports the `string` module to access the `digits` and `ascii_uppercase` attributes, which provide the symbols for the conversion.
#
#Overall, the code appears to be functioning correctly and does not require any fixes.
