#lcs_length.py
#
#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j] + 1`. 
#
#When `i` is 0, `dp[i - 1, j]` will result in an error because there is no key `(-1, j)` in the `dp` dictionary. 
#
#To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if `i` is 0 before accessing `dp[i - 1, j]`. If `i` is 0, we can set `dp[i, j]` to 1 instead of trying to access `dp[i - 1, j]`. Here's the updated code:
#
#```python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    from collections import Counter
#
    dp = Counter()
#
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(len(t)):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                if i == 0:
                    dp[i, j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j] + 1
#
    return max(dp.values()) if dp else 0
#```
#
#With this fix, the code should work correctly.
