#bucketsort.py
#
#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the second for loop, the code should iterate over the range of `k` instead of `arr`. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def bucketsort(arr, k):
    counts = [0] * k
    for x in arr:
        counts[x] += 1
#
    sorted_arr = []
    for i in range(k):
        sorted_arr.extend([i] * counts[i])
#
    return sorted_arr
#```
#
#This will ensure that the elements are sorted correctly based on their counts.
