#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the condition `if hare is None or hare.successor is None:`. This condition should check if either `hare` or `hare.successor` is `None`, but it only checks if `hare` is `None`. 
#
#To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to `if hare is None or hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:`. This way, it will correctly check if either `hare`, `hare.successor`, or `hare.successor.successor` is `None`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```
def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node
#
    while True:
        if hare is None or hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:
            return False
#
        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor
#
        if hare is tortoise:
            return True
#```
