#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the `get` function. Currently, if the wanted_node is not found in the node_heap, the function returns 0 instead of returning None. This can lead to incorrect results in the algorithm.
#
#To fix this bug, we need to change the return statement in the `get` function to return None instead of 0 when the wanted_node is not found. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def get(node_heap, wanted_node):
    for dist, node in node_heap:
        if node == wanted_node:
            return dist
    return None
#```
#
#With this fix, the `get` function will correctly return None when the wanted_node is not found in the node_heap.
