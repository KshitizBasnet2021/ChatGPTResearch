#There is a bug in the provided code. The line `helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()` is incorrect. It is trying to find the helper peg by subtracting the start and end pegs from the set {1, 2, 3}, but this will not work correctly if the start or end peg is not 1, 2, or 3.
#
#To fix this bug, we can use a simple if-else statement to determine the helper peg based on the start and end pegs. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = 6 - start - end
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end))
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))
#
    return steps
#```
#
#In this code, we calculate the helper peg by subtracting the start and end pegs from 6, which is the sum of all peg numbers (1 + 2 + 3). This ensures that the helper peg is always the remaining peg that is not the start or end peg.
