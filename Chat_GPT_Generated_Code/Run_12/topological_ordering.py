#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:`. 
#
#The `issuperset()` method checks if all elements of a set are present in another set. However, in this case, `nextnode.incoming_nodes` is not a set, but a list. So, the condition will always evaluate to `False` and the `nextnode` will never be added to `ordered_nodes`.
#
#To fix this bug, we need to convert `nextnode.incoming_nodes` to a set before checking if it is a subset of `ordered_nodes`. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
#
    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(set(nextnode.incoming_nodes)) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
#
    return ordered_nodes
#```
#
#Now, the code will correctly check if all incoming nodes of `nextnode` are present in `ordered_nodes` before adding it to the list.
