#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The range in the for loop should be adjusted to `range(a, b + 1)` instead of `range(a, b + 1 - k)`. This is because we want to include the value `b` in the range, and the current range is excluding it. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return [[]]
#
    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        ret.extend(
            [i] + rest for rest in subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)
        )
#
    return ret
