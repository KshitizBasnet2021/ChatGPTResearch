#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if node is goalnode:`. The `is` operator is used to check if two objects are the same object, not if they have the same value. To fix this, we should use the `==` operator instead. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
from collections import deque as Queue
#
def breadth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    queue = Queue()
    queue.append(startnode)
#
    nodesseen = set()
    nodesseen.add(startnode)
#
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
#
        if node == goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            queue.extend(node for node in node.successors if node not in nodesseen)
            nodesseen.update(node.successors)
#
    return False
#```
#
#This code will correctly check if the `node` is equal to the `goalnode` using the `==` operator.
