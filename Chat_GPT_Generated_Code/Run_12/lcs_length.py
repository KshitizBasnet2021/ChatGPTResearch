#lcs_length.py
#
#The provided code has a bug in the inner loop. The indices used to access the dp dictionary are incorrect. The correct indices should be `i-1` and `j-1` instead of `i` and `j`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    from collections import Counter
#
    dp = Counter()
#
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(len(t)):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1
#
    return max(dp.values()) if dp else 0
#```
#
#This code calculates the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings `s` and `t`.
