#minimum_spanning_tree.py
#
#The code provided seems to be implementing Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. However, there is a bug in the code that needs to be fixed.
#
#The bug is in the line `if group_by_node.setdefault(u, {u}) != group_by_node.setdefault(v, {v}):`. The `setdefault()` method is used to set a default value for a key if it does not exist in the dictionary. However, in this case, it is also updating the value of the key if it already exists, which is not the intended behavior.
#
#To fix this bug, we can use the `get()` method instead of `setdefault()` to retrieve the value of the key without modifying it. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):
    group_by_node = {}
    mst_edges = set()
#
    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.__getitem__):
        u, v = edge
        if group_by_node.get(u, {u}) != group_by_node.get(v, {v}):
            mst_edges.add(edge)
            group_by_node.setdefault(u, {u}).update(group_by_node.get(v, {v}))
            for node in group_by_node.get(v, {v}):
                group_by_node[node] = group_by_node[u]
#
    return mst_edges
#```
#
#In the corrected code, we use `get()` method to retrieve the values of `u` and `v` from `group_by_node` dictionary without modifying them. We also use `setdefault()` method to update the value of `u` with the union of its current value and the value of `v`.
