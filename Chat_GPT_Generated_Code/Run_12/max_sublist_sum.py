#max_sublist_sum.py
#
#The provided code is correct and does not have any bugs. It implements the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a subarray in an array. The code iterates through the array and keeps track of the maximum sum ending at each position and the maximum sum seen so far. It correctly returns the maximum sum of a subarray.
