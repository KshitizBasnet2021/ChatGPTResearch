#to_base.py
#
#The provided code has two implementations of the `to_base` function. The first implementation is commented out, and the second implementation is active. 
#
#The second implementation of the `to_base` function is correct and does not have any bugs. It converts a given number `num` to its representation in base `b` using the provided alphabet.
#
#If you want to use the first implementation instead, you can uncomment it by removing the triple quotes at the beginning and end of the code block. However, note that the first implementation returns the result in reverse order, so you would need to reverse it again to get the correct output.
