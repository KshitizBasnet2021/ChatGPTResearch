#get_factors.py
#
#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the second implementation of the `get_factors` function. 
#
#In the second implementation, the for loop iterates from 2 to n+1, which includes n itself. However, the condition `n % i == 0` will be true for n itself, resulting in an incorrect factorization. 
#
#To fix this bug, we need to change the range of the for loop to iterate from 2 to n (exclusive). Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def get_factors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return []
#
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return [i] + get_factors(n // i)
#
    return []
#```
#
#This code will correctly find all the factors of a given number.
