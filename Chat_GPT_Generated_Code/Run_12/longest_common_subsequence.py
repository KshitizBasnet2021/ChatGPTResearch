#longest_common_subsequence.py
#
#The provided code is missing a base case for when both strings are empty. This can be fixed by adding an additional condition at the beginning of the function to check if both strings are empty, and if so, return an empty string.
#
#Here is the updated code:
#
def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return ''
#
    elif a[0] == b[0]:
        return a[0] + longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:])
#
    elif not a and not b:
        return ''
#
    else:
        return max(
            longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]),
            longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b),
            key=len
        )
