#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the condition of the while loop. 
#
#The condition should be `abs(x - approx ** 2) > epsilon` instead of `abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon`. 
#
#To fix the bug, you can replace the line `while abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon:` with `while abs(x - approx ** 2) > epsilon:`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    approx = x / 2
    while abs(x - approx ** 2) > epsilon:
        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)
    return approx
#```
