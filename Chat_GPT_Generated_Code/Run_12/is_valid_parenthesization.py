#is_valid_parenthesization.py
#
#The provided code is correct and does not contain any bugs. It correctly checks if the given string of parentheses is a valid parenthesization by keeping track of the depth of the parentheses. If the depth becomes negative at any point, it means there is a closing parenthesis without a corresponding opening parenthesis, so the code returns False. If the depth is zero at the end, it means all parentheses are properly balanced, so the code returns True.
