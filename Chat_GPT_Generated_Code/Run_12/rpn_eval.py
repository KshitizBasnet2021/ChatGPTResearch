#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the `op` function where the order of the operands is incorrect. The correct order should be `a` followed by `b`, but the code currently has `b` followed by `a`. 
#
#To fix the bug, you can modify the `op` function as follows:
#
#```python
def op(symbol, a, b):
    return {
        '+': lambda a, b: a + b,
        '-': lambda a, b: a - b,
        '*': lambda a, b: a * b,
        '/': lambda a, b: a / b
    }[symbol](a, b)
#```
#
#This will ensure that the operands are used in the correct order when performing the operation.
