#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is that the code does not handle the case when all the digits in the input list are 9. In this case, the code should return a new list with all digits set to 0 except for the first and last digits which should be set to 1. 
#
#To fix this bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the function to see if all the digits in the input list are 9. If they are, we can return a new list with all digits set to 0 except for the first and last digits which should be set to 1. Here's the updated code:
#
def next_palindrome(digit_list):
    if all(digit == 9 for digit in digit_list):
        return [1] + (len(digit_list) - 1) * [0] + [1]
    
    high_mid = len(digit_list) // 2
    low_mid = (len(digit_list) - 1) // 2
    while high_mid < len(digit_list) and low_mid >= 0:
        if digit_list[high_mid] == 9:
            digit_list[high_mid] = 0
            digit_list[low_mid] = 0
            high_mid += 1
            low_mid -= 1
        else:
            digit_list[high_mid] += 1
            if low_mid != high_mid:
                digit_list[low_mid] += 1
            return digit_list
    return [1] + (len(digit_list) - 1) * [0] + [1]
