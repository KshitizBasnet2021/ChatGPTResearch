#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the line `longest = max(length + 1, longest)`, the order of the arguments passed to the `max()` function is incorrect. It should be `max(longest, length + 1)` instead. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def lis(arr):
    ends = {}
    longest = 0
#
    for i, val in enumerate(arr):
#
        prefix_lengths = [j for j in range(1, longest + 1) if arr[ends[j]] < val]
#
        length = max(prefix_lengths) if prefix_lengths else 0
#
        if length == longest or val < arr[ends[length + 1]]:
            ends[length + 1] = i
            longest = max(longest, length + 1)
#
    return longest
#```
