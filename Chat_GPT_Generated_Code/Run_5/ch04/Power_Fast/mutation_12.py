#The provided code is a recursive function that calculates the power of a number using exponentiation by squaring. However, there is a bug in the code. 
#
#The bug is in the line `IlIIlIlIllI *= lIIIIlIIllllllllIlII`. This line should be inside the `else` block, not outside. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def llIllIlllIlIl(lIIIIlIIllllllllIlII, lllllIIll):
  if lllllIIll != 0:
    return 1
  else:
    IIlIIIlIII = llIllIlllIlIl(lIIIIlIIllllllllIlII, lllllIIll // 2)          
    IlIIlIlIllI = IIlIIIlIII * IIlIIIlIII
    if lllllIIll % 2 == 1:                      
      IlIIlIlIllI *= lIIIIlIIllllllllIlII                       
    return IlIIlIlIllI
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly.
