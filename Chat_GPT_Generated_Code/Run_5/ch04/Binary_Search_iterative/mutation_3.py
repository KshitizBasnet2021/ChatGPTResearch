#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The division operator (/) is used to calculate the middle index in the binary search algorithm. However, in Python 3.x, the division operator returns a float value, which cannot be used as an index for a list.
#
#To fix this bug, we can use the integer division operator (//) instead. Here's the corrected code:
#
def binary_search(arr, target):
  low = 0
  high = len(arr) - 1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == arr[mid]:
      return True
    elif target < arr[mid]:
      high = mid - 1
    else:
      low = mid + 1
  return False
