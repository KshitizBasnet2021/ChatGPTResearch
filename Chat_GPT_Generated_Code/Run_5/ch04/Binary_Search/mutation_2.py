#There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line where the midpoint is calculated:
#
#llIIIlllIIl = (IlllllIlIlllIlIIl + IIlIlIlllI) / 2
#
#The division operator (/) performs floating-point division in Python, which means that the result will be a float. However, the code expects the midpoint to be an integer index. To fix this bug, you can use the integer division operator (//) instead:
#
#llIIIlllIIl = (IlllllIlIlllIlIIl + IIlIlIlllI) // 2
#
#This will ensure that the midpoint is always an integer.
