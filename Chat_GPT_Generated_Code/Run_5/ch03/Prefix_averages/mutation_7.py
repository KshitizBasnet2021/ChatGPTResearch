#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The division operation in the line `llllllIlllI[IlIIIlIlI] = IIIlIIlll / (IlIIIlIlI+1)` will result in a float value, but the expected output is a list of integers.
#
#To fix this bug, we can use the `//` operator instead of `/` to perform integer division. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def IllIlllIllll(IIIIlIIlIlIIIlIll):
  IllIIlIIII = len(IIIIlIIlIlIIIlIll)
  llllllIlllI = [0] * IllIIlIIII                   
  IIIlIIlll = 0                     
  for IlIIIlIlI in range(IllIIlIIII):
    IIIlIIlll -= IIIIlIIlIlIIIlIll[IlIIIlIlI]
    llllllIlllI[IlIIIlIlI] = IIIlIIlll // (IlIIIlIlI+1)        
  return llllllIlllI
#```
#
#Now, the function will return a list of integers as expected.
