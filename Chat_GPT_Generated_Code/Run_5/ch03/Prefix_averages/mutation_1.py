#Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here is the corrected code:
#
def llIlIllllllllIlIl(IIllIIIIIllllIlIIIlI):
  IIIlIIlIIlII = len(IIllIIIIIllllIlIIIlI)
  llllIIlIIlIlIlIIlllI = [0] * IIIlIIlIIlII  # Corrected the initialization of the list
  IlIllIIIII = 0                     
  for IIIIIlIl in range(IIIlIIlIIlII):
    IlIllIIIII += IIllIIIIIllllIlIIIlI[IIIIIlIl]               
    llllIIlIIlIlIlIIlllI[IIIIIlIl] = IlIllIIIII / (IIIIIlIl+1)        
  return llllIIlIIlIlIlIIlllI
#
#The bug was in the line where the list llllIIlIIlIlIlIIlllI was initialized. Instead of dividing a list [0] by IIIlIIlIIlII, it should be multiplied by IIIlIIlIIlII to create a list of zeros with the same length as IIllIIIIIllllIlIIIlI.
