#The provided code has a bug. The return statement is placed inside the innermost loop, which means it will return False as soon as it finds a mismatch in the values. However, the desired behavior is to check all possible combinations before returning True.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def lIIIlIIIlIIIlI(lIlIllIllIlIllIIII, lIlIIIlIlIll, lIlIIIIIl):
  for IIlIllIlIIIII in lIlIllIllIlIllIIII:
    for lIllIllllllIIlIlll in lIlIIIlIlIll:
      for IlIIllIIlIlI in lIlIIIIIl:
        if not (IIlIllIlIIIII == lIllIllllllIIlIlll == IlIIllIIlIlI):
          return False      
  return True
#
#Now, the return statement is placed outside all the loops, ensuring that all possible combinations are checked before returning True.
