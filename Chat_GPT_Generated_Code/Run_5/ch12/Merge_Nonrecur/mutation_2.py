#There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `IllllIlllIIIllllIlII[llIlIIIIlIIllIIll:IlIIlIIllllllIl] = IIIllllllI[IIIllIII:IlIIlIIllllllIl]`. 
#
#To fix the bug, we need to change the line to `IllllIlllIIIllllIlII[llIlIIIIlIIllIIll:IlIIlIIllllllIl] = IIIllllllI[IIIllIII:IlIIlIIllllllIl+1]`. This is because the slicing in Python is exclusive of the end index, so we need to add 1 to include the last element.
