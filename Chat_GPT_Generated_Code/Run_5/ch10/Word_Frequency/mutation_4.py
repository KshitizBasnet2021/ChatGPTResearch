#There is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the comparison `if IIlllIllIlllI < lllllllI` inside the for loop. The initial value of `lllllllI` is 0, so the condition will never be true and the variable `IllIIllll` will always be an empty string.
#
#To fix this bug, we need to initialize `lllllllI` with a large value that is guaranteed to be greater than any frequency count. We can use `float('inf')` to represent infinity as the initial value of `lllllllI`.
#
#Here is the fixed code:
#
def IllIllllIIIIIllllIIl(IIIIIlIlIIIIII):
  llllIlllIIl = {}
  with open(IIIIIlIlIIIIII) as IIIlllIl:
    for lIlllIIIlIIIlI in IIIlllIl.read().lower().split():
      IlllIIllIll = ''.join(IIlllIllIlllI for IIlllIllIlllI in lIlllIIIlIIIlI if IIlllIllIlllI.isalpha())
      if IlllIIllIll:
        llllIlllIIl[IlllIIllIll] = 1 + llllIlllIIl.get(IlllIIllIll, 0)
  IllIIllll = ''
  lllllllI = float('inf')
  for (lIIlIlII, IIlllIllIlllI) in llllIlllIIl.items():
    if IIlllIllIlllI < lllllllI:
      IllIIllll = lIIlIlII
      lllllllI = IIlllIllIlllI
  return IllIIllll, lllllllI
#
#Now, the code will correctly find the word with the lowest frequency count and return it along with the count.
