#The provided code is missing the base case for the merge_sort function. It should return when the length of the list is less than 2. Additionally, the merge function is not handling the case when S1 and S2 have different lengths. Here's the corrected code:
#
def merge(S1, S2, S):
  i = j = 0
  while i < len(S1) and j < len(S2):
    if S1[i] <= S2[j]:
      S[i+j] = S1[i]
      i += 1
    else:
      S[i+j] = S2[j]
      j += 1
  while i < len(S1):
    S[i+j] = S1[i]
    i += 1
  while j < len(S2):
    S[i+j] = S2[j]
    j += 1
#
def merge_sort(S):
  n = len(S)
  if n < 2:
    return S
  mid = n // 2
  S1 = S[0:mid]
  S2 = S[mid:n]
  merge_sort(S1)
  merge_sort(S2)
  merge(S1, S2, S)
  return S
