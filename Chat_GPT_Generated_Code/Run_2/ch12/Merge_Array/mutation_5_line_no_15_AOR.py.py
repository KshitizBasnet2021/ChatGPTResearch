#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the mid index in the merge_sort function. 
#
#The correct calculation of the mid index should be `mid = n // 2` instead of `mid = n * 2`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def merge(S1, S2, S):
  i = j = 0
  while i + j < len(S):
    if j == len(S2) or (i < len(S1) and S1[i] < S2[j]):
      S[i+j] = S1[i]
      i += 1
    else:
      S[i+j] = S2[j]
      j += 1
#
def merge_sort(S):
  n = len(S)
  if n < 2:
    return
  mid = n // 2
  S1 = S[0:mid]
  S2 = S[mid:n]
  merge_sort(S1)
  merge_sort(S2)
  merge(S1, S2, S)
#```
#
#With this fix, the merge_sort function should work correctly.
