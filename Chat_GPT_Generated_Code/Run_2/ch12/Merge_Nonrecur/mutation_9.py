#There is a bug in the provided code. In the line `(src, dest) = (S, [None] ** n)`, the code is attempting to create a list of length `n` filled with `None` values. However, the syntax `[None] ** n` does not create the desired list. 
#
#To fix this bug, you can replace that line with `(src, dest) = (S, [None] * n)`. This will create a list of length `n` filled with `None` values.
