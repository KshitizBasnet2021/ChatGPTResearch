#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 
#
#In the line `(src, dest) = (S, [None] // n)`, the division operator `//` is used instead of the list multiplication operator `*`. 
#
#To fix this, we need to change `//` to `*` so that the `dest` list is initialized with `None` repeated `n` times. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
#(src, dest) = (S, [None] * n)
#```
#
#With this fix, the code should work correctly.
