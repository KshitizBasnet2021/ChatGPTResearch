#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 
#
#In the line `(src, dest) = (S, [None] / n)`, there is a typo. Instead of dividing `[None]` by `n`, it should be divided by `n` using the `/` operator. 
#
#The corrected line should be `(src, dest) = (S, [None] * n)`. 
#
#This will create a list of `None` values with the same length as `S`.
