#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The while loop condition should be modified to check if k is less than m and if the characters at T[i + k] and P[k] are equal. Additionally, the return statement should be modified to return the index i+k-m instead of just i.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i+k-m
  return -1
