#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop condition, it should be `T[i + k] == P[k]` instead of `T[i - k] == P[k]`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  for i in range(n-m+1):
    k = 0
    while (k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]):
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i
  return -1
#```
#
#This fix ensures that the characters in `T` and `P` are compared correctly.
