#Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[P[k]] = k
  i = m - 1
  k = m - 1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
#```
#
#Here are the changes made:
#
#1. Removed the extra line `k = m + 1` which was not needed.
#2. Added a `while` loop to iterate through the text `T`.
#3. Fixed the indentation of the `if` statement inside the loop.
#4. Corrected the calculation of `i` and `k` when there is a mismatch.
#5. Returned `-1` at the end if no match is found.
#
#Now the code should work correctly for finding the pattern `P` in the text `T` using the Boyer-Moore algorithm.
