#Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the corrected code:
#
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
#
#I have fixed the following bugs:
#
#1. In the line "else: else:i += 1", there is an extra "else" statement. I have removed it.
#
#2. In the line "i -= 1" inside the "if k == 0" condition, I have corrected it to "i -= 1" instead of "i += 1". This is because we need to move backwards in the text string when a mismatch occurs.
#
#With these fixes, the code should work correctly.
