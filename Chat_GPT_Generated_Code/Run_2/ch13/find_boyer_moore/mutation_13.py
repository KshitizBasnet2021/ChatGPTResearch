#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The indentation of the code is incorrect, which will cause a syntax error. The line `last = {}` should be indented to be inside the `if not (m == 0):` block. Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
    n, m = len(T), len(P)
    if not (m == 0):
        last = {}
        for k in range(m):
            last[P[k]] = k
        i = m - 1
        k = m - 1
        while i < n:
            if T[i] == P[k]:
                if k == 0:
                    return i
                else:
                    i -= 1
                    k -= 1
            else:
                j = last.get(T[i], -1)
                i += m - min(k, j + 1)
                k = m - 1
    return -1
#```
#
#Now the code should run without any syntax errors.
