#Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the fixed code:
#
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    while k >= 0:
      if T[i] == P[k]:
        if k == 0:
          return i
        else:
          i -= 1
          k -= 1
      else:
        j = last.get(T[i], -1)
        i += m - min(k, j + 1)
        k = m - 1
    i += m
    k = m - 1
  return -1
#
#The bugs in the original code were:
#1. The condition in the inner while loop was incorrect. It should be "while k >= 0" instead of "while not (i < n)".
#2. The check for matching characters in the inner while loop was missing. I added an if condition to check if T[i] is equal to P[k].
#3. The calculation of the next index to compare was incorrect. It should be "i += m - min(k, j + 1)" instead of "i += m - min(k, j)".
#4. After the inner while loop, the code should increment i by m and reset k to m-1 to continue searching for the next occurrence of P in T.
