#Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided code. Here's the fixed code:
#
#```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
    n, m = len(T), len(P)
    if m == 0:
        return 0
    last = {}
    for k in range(m):
        last[P[k]] = k
    i = m - 1
    k = m - 1
    while i < n:
        while k >= 0:
            if T[i] == P[k]:
                if k == 0:
                    return i
                else:
                    i -= 1
                    k -= 1
            else:
                break
        j = last.get(T[i], -1)
        i += m - min(k, j + 1)
        k = m - 1
    return -1
#```
#
#Here are the changes made:
#
#1. In the inner while loop, the condition `i <= n` should be `i >= 0` to iterate backwards through the string.
#2. Added a check inside the inner while loop to compare `T[i]` with `P[k]` and break the loop if they are not equal.
#3. Fixed the calculation of `i` in the outer while loop to correctly update the index.
#4. Fixed the calculation of `k` in the outer while loop to reset it to `m - 1` after each iteration.
