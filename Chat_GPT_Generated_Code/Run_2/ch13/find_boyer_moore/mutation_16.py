#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The line `if not (k == 0):` is unnecessary and should be removed. Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find_boyer_moore(T, P):
  n, m = len(T), len(P)
  if m == 0: return 0
  last = {}
  for k in range(m):
    last[ P[k] ] = k
  i = m-1
  k = m-1
  while i < n:
    if T[i] == P[k]:
      if k == 0:
        return i
      else:
        i -= 1
        k -= 1
    else:
      j = last.get(T[i], -1)
      i += m - min(k, j + 1)
      k = m - 1
  return -1
#```
#
#This code implements the Boyer-Moore algorithm for string searching. It finds the first occurrence of pattern `P` in text `T` and returns the index of the first character of the match. If no match is found, it returns -1.
