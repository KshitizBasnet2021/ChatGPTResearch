#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The line `mid = (low + high) / 2` performs integer division in Python 2.x, which means that the result will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. This can cause issues when the length of the data list is an odd number.
#
#To fix this bug, we can use the `//` operator for floor division instead of `/`. This will ensure that the result is always an integer.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      high = mid - 1
    else:
      low = mid + 1
  return False
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly for both even and odd-length data lists.
