#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the `elif` condition where it checks if the target is not less than the middle element. The correct condition should be `elif target < data[mid]:` instead of `elif not (target < data[mid]):`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      high = mid - 1
    else:
      low = mid + 1
  return False
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly for performing an iterative binary search.
