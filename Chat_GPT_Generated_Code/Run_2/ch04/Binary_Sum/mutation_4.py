#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the midpoint (mid) in the recursive call. 
#
#The correct calculation of the midpoint should be (start + stop) // 2, which is the integer division. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  if start >= stop:
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:
    return S[start]
  else:
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
