#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the first if statement is incorrect. It should be `if not (start < stop):` instead of `if not (start >= stop):`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  if not (start < stop):
    return 0
  elif start == stop-1:
    return S[start]
  else:
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
