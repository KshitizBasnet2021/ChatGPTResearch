#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `elif start != stop - 1:` is incorrect and should be `elif start == stop - 1:`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  if start >= stop:
    return 0
  elif start == stop - 1:
    return S[start]
  else:
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
#```
#
#This code recursively divides the list `S` into halves until the start and stop indices are adjacent. It then returns the sum of the elements at the start index.
