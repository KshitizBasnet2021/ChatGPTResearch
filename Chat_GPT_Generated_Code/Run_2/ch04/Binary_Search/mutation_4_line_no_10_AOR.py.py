#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the recursive calls to the binary_search function when the target is less than the middle element. 
#
#To fix the bug, we need to update the recursive calls to binary_search as follows:
#
#- Change `return binary_search(data, target, low, mid + 1)` to `return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)`
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
  if low > high:
    return False
  else:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
    else:
      return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
