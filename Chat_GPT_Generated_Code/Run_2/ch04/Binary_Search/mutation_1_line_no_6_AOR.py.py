#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the middle index. 
#
#The line `mid = (low - high) // 2` should be changed to `mid = (low + high) // 2`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
    if low > high:
        return False
    else:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if target == data[mid]:
            return True
        elif target < data[mid]:
            return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
#```
#
#This fix ensures that the middle index is calculated correctly, which is the average of the low and high indices.
