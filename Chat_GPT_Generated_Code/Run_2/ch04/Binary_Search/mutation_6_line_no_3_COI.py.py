#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the if statement on line 3 is incorrect. It should be `if low > high:` instead of `if not (low > high):`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
    if low > high:
        return False
    else:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if target == data[mid]:
            return True
        elif target < data[mid]:
            return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
#```
#
#This fix ensures that the function returns False when the low index becomes greater than the high index, indicating that the target element is not present in the data.
