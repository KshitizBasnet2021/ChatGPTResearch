#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `if low < high:` should be `if low <= high:`. This is because when `low` is equal to `high`, there is still one element left to be checked, so we need to include that element in the search.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
    if low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if target == data[mid]:
            return True
        elif target < data[mid]:
            return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
    else:
        return False
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly.
