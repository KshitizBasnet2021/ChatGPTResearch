#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 
#
#The bug is in the recursive calls to `binary_search` when the target is not equal to the middle element. 
#
#To fix the bug, we need to change the conditions in the recursive calls. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
    if low > high:
        return False
    else:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if target == data[mid]:
            return True
        elif target < data[mid]:
            return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
#```
#
#In the original code, the condition `not (target < data[mid])` should be changed to `target < data[mid]`. This is because if the target is not equal to the middle element, we need to search in either the left half or the right half of the array, depending on whether the target is less than or greater than the middle element.
