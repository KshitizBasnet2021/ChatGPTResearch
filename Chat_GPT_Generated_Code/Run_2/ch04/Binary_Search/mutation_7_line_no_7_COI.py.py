#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if not (target == data[mid]):`. This condition should be checking if the target is equal to the data[mid], but instead it is checking if they are not equal. This will cause the function to return True when the target is found, which is incorrect.
#
#To fix this bug, we can simply remove the `not` operator from the condition. Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
    if low > high:
        return False
    else:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if target == data[mid]:
            return True
        elif target < data[mid]:
            return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
#```
#
#Now the function will correctly return True when the target is found and False when it is not found.
