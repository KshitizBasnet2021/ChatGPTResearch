#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the calculation of the mid index. Instead of `(low + high) * 2`, it should be `(low + high) // 2` to find the middle index correctly.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search(data, target, low, high):
    if low > high:
        return False
    else:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if target == data[mid]:
            return True
        elif target < data[mid]:
            return binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high)
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly for performing a binary search.
