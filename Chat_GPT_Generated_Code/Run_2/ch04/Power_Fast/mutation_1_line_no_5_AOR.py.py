#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `partial = power(x, n / 2)`. The division operator `/` performs floating-point division in Python, which means that `n / 2` will always result in a float value. However, the function is expecting `n` to be an integer.
#
#To fix this bug, we can use the integer division operator `//` instead of `/`. This will ensure that the division operation returns an integer value.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def power(x, n):
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:
      result *= x                       
    return result
