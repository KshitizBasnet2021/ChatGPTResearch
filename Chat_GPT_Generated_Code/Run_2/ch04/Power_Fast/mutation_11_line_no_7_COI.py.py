#The code provided is a recursive implementation of the power function, which calculates the value of x raised to the power of n. 
#
#There is a bug in the code. The condition `if not (n % 2 == 1)` is incorrect. It should be `if n % 2 == 0` to check if n is even. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def power(x, n):
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 0:
      result *= x                       
    return result
