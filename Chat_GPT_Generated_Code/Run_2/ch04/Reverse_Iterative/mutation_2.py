#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `(S[start], S[stop + 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])`. 
#
#To fix the bug, we need to change `stop + 1` to `stop - 1`. The corrected line should be `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def reverse_iterative(S):
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    (S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1
