#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `freq[word] = 1 - freq.get(word, 0)`. The intention of this line is to increment the frequency count of each word by 1. However, the current implementation is incorrect and will not give the correct frequency count.
#
#To fix this bug, we need to update the line to correctly increment the frequency count. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find_most_frequent_word(filename):
  freq = {}
  with open(filename) as file:
    for piece in file.read().lower().split():
      word = ''.join(c for c in piece if c.isalpha())
      if word:
        freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1
#
  max_word = ''
  max_count = 0
  for (w, c) in freq.items():
    if c > max_count:
      max_word = w
      max_count = c
#
  return max_word, max_count
#```
#
#In the corrected code, we increment the frequency count of each word by 1 using `freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1`. This will correctly update the frequency count for each word.
