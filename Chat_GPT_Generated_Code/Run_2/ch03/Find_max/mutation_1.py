#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The logic inside the for loop is incorrect. Instead of checking if the current value is not greater than the current biggest value, it should be checking if the current value is greater than the current biggest value. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def find_max(data):
  biggest = data[0]
  for val in data:
    if val > biggest:
      biggest = val
  return biggest
