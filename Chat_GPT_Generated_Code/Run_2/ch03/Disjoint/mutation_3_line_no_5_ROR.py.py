#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `if a == b != c` checks if `a` is equal to `b` and not equal to `c`. However, this condition does not guarantee that `a`, `b`, and `c` are all distinct. 
#
#To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all distinct. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def disjoint1(A, B, C):
  for a in A:
    for b in B:
      for c in C:
        if a == b or a == c or b == c:
          return False
  return True
#```
#
#In this updated code, the condition `if a == b or a == c or b == c` checks if any two elements among `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal. If any such pair is found, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if no equal pairs are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the lists `A`, `B`, and `C` are disjoint.
