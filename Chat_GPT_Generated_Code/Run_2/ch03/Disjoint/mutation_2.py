#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `a != b == c` is incorrect. It should be `a != b and b != c and a != c` to check if all three elements are distinct.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def disjoint1(A, B, C):
  for a in A:
    for b in B:
      for c in C:
        if a != b and b != c and a != c:
          return False
  return True
