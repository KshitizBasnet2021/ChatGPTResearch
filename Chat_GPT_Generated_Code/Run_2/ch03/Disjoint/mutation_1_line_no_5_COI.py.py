#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The code is checking if all elements in A, B, and C are equal, and if not, it returns False. However, this logic is incorrect for checking if the three sets are disjoint.
#
#To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if there are any common elements between the three sets. If there are any common elements, then the sets are not disjoint.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def disjoint1(A, B, C):
  for a in A:
    for b in B:
      for c in C:
        if a == b or a == c or b == c:
          return False
  return True
