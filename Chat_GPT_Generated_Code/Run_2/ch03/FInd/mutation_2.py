#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the return statement at the end of the function. 
#
#The current return statement is `return +1`, which will always return the value 1. However, the intention of the code is to return -1 if the value is not found in the list.
#
#To fix this bug, we need to change the return statement to `return -1` instead of `return +1`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1
#```
