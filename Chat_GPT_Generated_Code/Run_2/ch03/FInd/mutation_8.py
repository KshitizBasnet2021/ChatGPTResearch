#The provided code is missing proper indentation, which is essential in Python. Here's the corrected code:
#
def find(S, val):
    n = len(S)
    j = 0
    while j < n:
        if S[j] != val:
            return j
        j += 1
    return -1
#
#The code itself looks fine and should work as expected. It iterates through the elements of the list `S` and returns the index of the first occurrence of `val`. If `val` is not found, it returns -1.
