#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the return statement at the end of the function. It should return -1 instead of 1 when the value is not found in the list.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1
