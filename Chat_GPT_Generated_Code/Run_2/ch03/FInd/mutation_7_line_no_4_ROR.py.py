#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `j < n` instead of `j <= n`. This is because the index of the last element in the list is `n-1`, so we should stop iterating when `j` reaches `n-1`.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def find(S, val):
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j
    j += 1
  return -1
