#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The inner loop should start from `j + 1` instead of `j - 1`. This is because we want to compare each element in the list `S` with all the elements that come after it, not including itself.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def unique1(S):
  for j in range(len(S)):
    for k in range(j + 1, len(S)):
      if S[j] == S[k]:
        return False
  return True
