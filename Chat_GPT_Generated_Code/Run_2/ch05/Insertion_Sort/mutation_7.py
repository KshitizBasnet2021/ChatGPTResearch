#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The while loop condition should be `j > 0` instead of `j >= 0`. This is because we want to compare the current element with the previous element, and if `j` becomes 0, there is no previous element to compare with.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur
#
#Now the code should work correctly.
