#The provided code is implementing an insertion sort algorithm. However, there is a bug in the code. The while loop condition should be checking if A[j - 1] > cur instead of A[j - 1] < cur. This is because we want to shift elements to the right until we find the correct position for the current element (cur) in the sorted portion of the array.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur
#
#Now the code should correctly sort the array in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
