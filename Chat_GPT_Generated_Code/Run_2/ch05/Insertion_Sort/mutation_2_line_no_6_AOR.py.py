#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop, when shifting elements to the right, the assignment `A[j] = A[j + 1]` should be `A[j] = A[j - 1]`. This will correctly shift the elements to the right. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > cur:
      A[j] = A[j - 1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur
#
#Now the code should correctly perform the insertion sort algorithm.
