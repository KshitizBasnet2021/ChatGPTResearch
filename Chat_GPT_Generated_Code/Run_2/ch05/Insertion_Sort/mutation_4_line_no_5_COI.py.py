#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. It should be "A[j - 1] > cur" instead of "not ((j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur))". 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def insertion_sort(A):
  for k in range(1, len(A)):
    cur = A[k]
    j = k
    while j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur:
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur
#
#Now the code should correctly sort the list using the insertion sort algorithm.
