#The code provided is almost correct, but there is a small bug in the while loop condition. The condition should be `j > 0` instead of `j >= 0` to avoid accessing an index out of range when `j` is 0.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while (j > 0 and A[j - 1] > cur):
      A[j] = A[j-1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place
#```
#
#With this correction, the code should work correctly to sort the list `A` in non-decreasing order using the insertion sort algorithm.
