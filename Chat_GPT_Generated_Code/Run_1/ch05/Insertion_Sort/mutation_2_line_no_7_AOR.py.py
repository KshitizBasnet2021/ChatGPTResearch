#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the while loop, when shifting elements to the right, the assignment `A[j] = A[j + 1]` should be `A[j] = A[j - 1]` to correctly shift the elements to the right. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def insertion_sort(A):
  """Sort list of comparable elements into nondecreasing order."""
  for k in range(1, len(A)):         # from 1 to n-1
    cur = A[k]                       # current element to be inserted
    j = k                            # find correct index j for current
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > cur:    # element A[j-1] must be after current
      A[j] = A[j - 1]
      j -= 1
    A[j] = cur                       # cur is now in the right place
