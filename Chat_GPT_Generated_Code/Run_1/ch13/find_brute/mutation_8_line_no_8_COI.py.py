#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the condition `if not (k == m):`. This condition should be `if k == m:` instead. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find_brute(T, P):
  """Return the lowest index of T at which substring P begins (or else -1)."""
  n, m = len(T), len(P)                      # introduce convenient notations
  for i in range(n-m+1):                     # try every potential starting index within T
    k = 0                                    # an index into pattern P
    while k < m and T[i + k] == P[k]:        # kth character of P matches
      k += 1
    if k == m:
      return i                               # substring T[i:i+m] matches P
  return -1                                  # failed to find a match starting with any i
#```
#
#In the corrected code, the condition `if k == m:` checks if the entire pattern `P` has been matched. If it has, then it returns the starting index `i`.
