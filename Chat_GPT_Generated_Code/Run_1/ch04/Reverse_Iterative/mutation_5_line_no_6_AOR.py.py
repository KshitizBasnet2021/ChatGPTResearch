#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The stop variable should be decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop, not incremented. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    (start, stop) = (start + 1, stop - 1)  # decrement stop by 1
#
#Now the code should correctly reverse the elements in the sequence S.
