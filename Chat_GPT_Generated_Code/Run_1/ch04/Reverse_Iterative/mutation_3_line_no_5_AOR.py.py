#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The assignment statement `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop + 1], S[start])` is incorrect. It should be `(S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])` to correctly swap the elements at the start and stop indices.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop - 1:
    (S[start], S[stop - 1]) = (S[stop - 1], S[start])
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1          # narrow the range
#
#Now the code should correctly reverse the elements in the sequence.
