#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `start < stop`, not `start < stop + 1`. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def reverse_iterative(S):
  """Reverse elements in sequence S."""
  start, stop = 0, len(S)
  while start < stop:
    S[start], S[stop-1] = S[stop-1], S[start]  # swap first and last
    start, stop = start + 1, stop - 1          # narrow the range
#
#This will correctly reverse the elements in the sequence.
