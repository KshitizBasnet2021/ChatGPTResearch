#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the while loop condition. The condition should be `low <= high` instead of `low < high`. This is because when `low` and `high` are equal, there is still one element left to be checked. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  """Return True if target is found in the given Python list."""
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:         # found a match
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      high = mid - 1                # only consider values left of mid
    else:
      low = mid + 1                 # only consider values right of mid
  return False                      # loop ended without success
#```
#
#Now the binary search algorithm should work correctly.
