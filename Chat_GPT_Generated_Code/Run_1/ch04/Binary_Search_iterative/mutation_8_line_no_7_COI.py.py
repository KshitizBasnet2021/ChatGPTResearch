#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if not (target == data[mid]):`. This condition should be checking if the target is equal to the data[mid], but instead it is checking if the target is not equal to the data[mid]. 
#
#To fix this bug, we can change the condition to `if target == data[mid]:`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def binary_search_iterative(data, target):
  """Return True if target is found in the given Python list."""
  low = 0
  high = len(data)-1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if target == data[mid]:
      return True
    elif target < data[mid]:
      high = mid - 1                # only consider values left of mid
    else:
      low = mid + 1                 # only consider values right of mid
  return False                      # loop ended without success
