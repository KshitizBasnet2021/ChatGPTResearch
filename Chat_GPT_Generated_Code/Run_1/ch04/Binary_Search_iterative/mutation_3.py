#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line where the middle index is calculated:
#
#mid = (low + high) / 2
#
#In Python 3.x, the division operator (/) performs floating-point division, which can result in a float value for the middle index. However, the list indices in Python must be integers.
#
#To fix this bug, we can use the integer division operator (//) instead:
#
#mid = (low + high) // 2
#
#This will ensure that the middle index is always an integer.
