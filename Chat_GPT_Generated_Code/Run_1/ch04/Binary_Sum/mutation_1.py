#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 
#
#The bug is in the line `elif start == stop + 1:`. This condition should be `elif start == stop:` because if `start` is equal to `stop + 1`, it means that there are no elements in the slice and we should return 0. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start == stop:
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly.
