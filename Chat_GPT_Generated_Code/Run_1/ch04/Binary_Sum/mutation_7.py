#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the elif statement is incorrect. It should be "if start == stop - 1" instead of "if not (start == stop - 1)". 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start == stop - 1:
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
