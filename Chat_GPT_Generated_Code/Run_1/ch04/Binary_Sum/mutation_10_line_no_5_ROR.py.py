#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `elif start != stop - 1:` is incorrect. It should be `elif start != stop:` to handle the case when there is only one element in the slice.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def binary_sum(S, start, stop):
  """Return the sum of the numbers in implicit slice S[start:stop]."""
  if start >= stop:                      # zero elements in slice
    return 0
  elif start != stop:
    return S[start]
  else:                                  # two or more elements in slice
    mid = (start + stop) // 2
    return binary_sum(S, start, mid) + binary_sum(S, mid, stop)
