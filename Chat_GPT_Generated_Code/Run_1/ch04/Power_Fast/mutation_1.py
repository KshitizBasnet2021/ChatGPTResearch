#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `partial = power(x, n / 2)`. The division operator `/` performs floating-point division in Python, which means that `n / 2` will always result in a float value, even if `n` is an integer. 
#
#To fix this bug, we can use the integer division operator `//` instead, which performs integer division and returns an integer result. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
#```
#
#Now, the code will correctly compute the value `x**n` for integer `n`.
