#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the recursive call to the power function. Instead of multiplying `x` by itself `n * 2` times, it should be multiplied `x` by itself `n // 2` times.
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
#```
#
#This code will correctly compute the value `x**n` for any integer `n`.
