#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The line `result **= x` should be `result *= x` to correctly include the extra factor of x when n is odd. Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x
    return result
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly.
