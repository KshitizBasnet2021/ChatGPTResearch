#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the if statement at the beginning of the function. The condition should be "if n == 0" instead of "if not (n == 0)". 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
