#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `result = partial ** partial`. It should be `result = partial * partial` instead. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def power(x, n):
  """Compute the value x**n for integer n."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    partial = power(x, n // 2)          # rely on truncated division
    result = partial * partial
    if n % 2 == 1:                      # if n odd, include extra factor of x
      result *= x                       
    return result
#```
#
#This fix ensures that the correct power is calculated by multiplying the partial result with itself, rather than raising it to the power of itself.
