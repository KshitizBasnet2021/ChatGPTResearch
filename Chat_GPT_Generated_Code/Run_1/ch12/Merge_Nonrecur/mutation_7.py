#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 
#
#In the line `(src, dest) = (S, [None] / n)`, the division operator `/` is used instead of the list repetition operator `*`. 
#
#To fix this, the line should be changed to `(src, dest) = (S, [None] * n)`. 
#
#This will create a list `dest` with `n` elements, each initialized to `None`.
