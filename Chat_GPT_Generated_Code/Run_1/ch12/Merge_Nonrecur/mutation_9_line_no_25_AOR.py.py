#There is a bug in the provided code. In the line `(src, dest) = (S, [None] ** n)`, the code is attempting to create a list of length `n` filled with `None` values. However, the syntax `[None] ** n` does not create a list of length `n`. Instead, it creates a list with a single element `None` and repeats that element `n` times.
#
#To fix this bug, you can use the `*` operator to repeat the `[None]` list `n` times. Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
#(src, dest) = (S, [None] * n)
#```
#
#This will create a list of length `n` filled with `None` values, which is what the code intends to do.
