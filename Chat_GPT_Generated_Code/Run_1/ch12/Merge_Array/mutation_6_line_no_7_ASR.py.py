#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. In the merge function, the line `i -= 1` should be changed to `i += 1` in order to correctly increment the index `i` when copying elements from `S1` to `S`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def merge(S1, S2, S):
  """Merge two sorted Python lists S1 and S2 into properly sized list S."""
  i = j = 0
  while i + j < len(S):
    if j == len(S2) or (i < len(S1) and S1[i] < S2[j]):
      S[i+j] = S1[i]      # copy ith element of S1 as next item of S
      i += 1              # increment i
    else:
      S[i+j] = S2[j]      # copy jth element of S2 as next item of S
      j += 1              # increment j
#
def merge_sort(S):
  """Sort the elements of Python list S using the merge-sort algorithm."""
  n = len(S)
  if n < 2:
    return                # list is already sorted
  # divide
  mid = n // 2
  S1 = S[0:mid]           # copy of first half
  S2 = S[mid:n]           # copy of second half
  # conquer (with recursion)
  merge_sort(S1)          # sort copy of first half
  merge_sort(S2)          # sort copy of second half
  # merge results
  merge(S1, S2, S)        # merge sorted halves back into S
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly.
