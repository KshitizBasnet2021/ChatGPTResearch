#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The inner loop should start from j + 1 instead of j - 1. This is because we want to compare each element with the elements that come after it, not the ones before it. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def unique1(S):
  """Return True if there are no duplicate elements in sequence S."""
  for j in range(len(S)):
    for k in range(j + 1, len(S)):
      if S[j] == S[k]:
        return False              # found duplicate pair
  return True                     # if we reach this, elements were unique
#
