#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition `if not (S[j] == S[k])` is incorrect. It should be `if S[j] == S[k]` to check if there are any duplicate elements. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
def unique1(S):
  """Return True if there are no duplicate elements in sequence S."""
  for j in range(len(S)):
    for k in range(j+1, len(S)):
      if S[j] == S[k]:
        return False              # found duplicate pair
  return True                     # if we reach this, elements were unique
#
