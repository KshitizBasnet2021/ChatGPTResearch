#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the condition `if a == b != c`. This condition checks if `a` is equal to `b` and not equal to `c`. However, this condition does not check if `a` is equal to `c`. 
#
#To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to `if a == b and a != c`. This condition checks if `a` is equal to `b` and not equal to `c`, ensuring that all three elements are not equal. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def disjoint1(A, B, C):
  """Return True if there is no element common to all three lists."""
  for a in A:
    for b in B:
      for c in C:
        if a == b and a != c:
          return False      # we found a common value
  return True               # if we reach this, sets are disjoint
#```
#
#Now the code should correctly determine if there is no element common to all three lists.
