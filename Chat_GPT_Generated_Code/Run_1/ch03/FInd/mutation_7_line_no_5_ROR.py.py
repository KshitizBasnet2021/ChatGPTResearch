#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The condition in the while loop should be `j < n` instead of `j <= n`. This is because the indices of a list in Python start from 0 and go up to `n-1`, so the loop should iterate until `j` is less than `n`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
def find(S, val):
  """Return index j such that S[j] == val, or -1 if no such element."""
  n = len(S)
  j = 0
  while j < n:
    if S[j] == val:
      return j          # a match was found at index j
    j += 1
  return -1
