#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. 
#
#The bug is in the line `A = [0] // n`. The double forward slashes (`//`) are used for integer division, but in this case, we want to create a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0. To fix this, we should use square brackets (`[]`) instead of double forward slashes. 
#
#Here's the corrected code:
#
#```python
def prefix_average3(S):
  """Return list such that, for all j, A[j] equals average of S[0], ..., S[j]."""
  n = len(S)
  A = [0] * n
  total = 0                     # compute prefix sum as S[0] + S[1] + ...
  for j in range(n):
    total += S[j]               # update prefix sum to include S[j]
    A[j] = total / (j+1)        # compute average based on current sum
  return A
#```
#
#Now the code should work correctly and return the desired list.
