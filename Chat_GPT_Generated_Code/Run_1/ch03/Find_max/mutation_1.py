#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the comparison condition inside the if statement. The condition should be `if val > biggest` instead of `if not (val > biggest)`. 
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find_max(data):
  """Return the maximum element from a nonempty Python list."""
  biggest = data[0]               # The initial value to beat
  for val in data:                # For each value:
    if val > biggest:
      biggest = val               # we have found a new best (so far)
  return biggest                  # When loop ends, biggest is the max
#```
#
#This code will correctly find the maximum element from a nonempty list.
