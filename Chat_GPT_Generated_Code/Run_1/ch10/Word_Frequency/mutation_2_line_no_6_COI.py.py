#Yes, there is a bug in the provided code. The bug is in the line `if not word:`. This condition is checking if the word is empty, but it should be checking if the word is not empty. 
#
#To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if word:`. This will ensure that only non-empty words are counted in the frequency dictionary.
#
#Here is the corrected code:
#
#```python
def find_most_frequent_word(filename):
  freq = {}
  with open(filename) as file:
    for piece in file.read().lower().split():
      word = ''.join(c for c in piece if c.isalpha())
      if word:
        freq[word] = 1 + freq.get(word, 0)
#
  max_word = ''
  max_count = 0
  for (w, c) in freq.items():
    if c > max_count:
      max_word = w
      max_count = c
#
  return max_word, max_count
#```
#
#Now the code should correctly count the frequency of non-empty words in the file.
